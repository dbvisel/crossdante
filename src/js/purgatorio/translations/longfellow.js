<p class="cantohead">Purgatorio: Canto I</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>To run o&rsquo;et better waters hoists its sail</p>
<p class="slindent">The little vessel of my genius now,</p>
<p class="slindent">That leaves behind itself a sea so cruel;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And of that second kingdom will I sing</p>
<p class="slindent">Wherein the human spirit doth purge itself,</p>
<p class="slindent">And to ascend to heaven becometh worthy.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But let dead Poesy here rise again,</p>
<p class="slindent">O holy Muses, since that I am yours,</p>
<p class="slindent">And here Calliope somewhat ascend,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>My song accompanying with that sound,</p>
<p class="slindent">Of which the miserable magpies felt</p>
<p class="slindent">The blow so great, that they despaired of pardon.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Sweet colour of the oriental sapphire,</p>
<p class="slindent">That was upgathered in the cloudless aspect</p>
<p class="slindent">Of the pure air, as far as the first circle,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Unto mine eyes did recommence delight</p>
<p class="slindent">Soon as I issued forth from the dead air,</p>
<p class="slindent">Which had with sadness filled mine eyes and breast.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The beauteous planet, that to love incites,</p>
<p class="slindent">Was making all the orient to laugh,</p>
<p class="slindent">Veiling the Fishes that were in her escort.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>To the right hand I turned, and fixed my mind</p>
<p class="slindent">Upon the other pole, and saw four stars</p>
<p class="slindent">Ne&rsquo;et seen before save by the primal people.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Rejoicing in their flamelets seemed the heaven.</p>
<p class="slindent">O thou septentrional and widowed site,</p>
<p class="slindent">Because thou art deprived of seeing these!</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>When from regarding them I had withdrawn,</p>
<p class="slindent">Turning a little to the other pole,</p>
<p class="slindent">There where the Wain had disappeared already,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I saw beside me an old man alone,</p>
<p class="slindent">Worthy of so much reverence in his look,</p>
<p class="slindent">That more owes not to father any son.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>A long beard and with white hair intermingled</p>
<p class="slindent">He wore, in semblance like unto the tresses,</p>
<p class="slindent">Of which a double list fell on his breast.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The rays of the four consecrated stars</p>
<p class="slindent">Did so adorn his countenance with light,</p>
<p class="slindent">That him I saw as were the sun before him.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Who are you? ye who, counter the blind river,</p>
<p class="slindent">Have fled away from the eternal prison?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Moving those venerable plumes, he said:</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Who guided you? or who has been your lamp</p>
<p class="slindent">In issuing forth out of the night profound,</p>
<p class="slindent">That ever black makes the infernal valley?</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The laws of the abyss, are they thus broken?</p>
<p class="slindent">Or is there changed in heaven some council new,</p>
<p class="slindent">That being damned ye come unto my crags?&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then did my Leader lay his grasp upon me,</p>
<p class="slindent">And with his words, and with his hands and signs,</p>
<p class="slindent">Reverent he made in me my knees and brow;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then answered him: &ldquo;I came not of myself;</p>
<p class="slindent">A Lady from Heaven descended, at whose prayers</p>
<p class="slindent">I aided this one with my company.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But since it is thy will more be unfolded</p>
<p class="slindent">Of our condition, how it truly is,</p>
<p class="slindent">Mine cannot be that this should be denied thee.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>This one has never his last evening seen,</p>
<p class="slindent">But by his folly was so near to it</p>
<p class="slindent">That very little time was there to turn.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>As I have said, I unto him was sent</p>
<p class="slindent">To rescue him, and other way was none</p>
<p class="slindent">Than this to which I have myself betaken.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I&rsquo;ve shown him all the people of perdition,</p>
<p class="slindent">And now those spirits I intend to show</p>
<p class="slindent">Who purge themselves beneath thy guardianship.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>How I have brought him would be long to tell thee.</p>
<p class="slindent">Virtue descendeth from on high that aids me</p>
<p class="slindent">To lead him to behold thee and to hear thee.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Now may it please thee to vouchsafe his coming;</p>
<p class="slindent">He seeketh Liberty, which is so dear,</p>
<p class="slindent">As knoweth he who life for her refuses.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thou know&rsquo;st it; since, for her, to thee not bitter</p>
<p class="slindent">Was death in Utica, where thou didst leave</p>
<p class="slindent">The vesture, that will shine so, the great day.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>By us the eternal edicts are not broken;</p>
<p class="slindent">Since this one lives, and Minos binds not me;</p>
<p class="slindent">But of that circle I, where are the chaste</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Eyes of thy Marcia, who in looks still prays thee,</p>
<p class="slindent">O holy breast, to hold her as thine own;</p>
<p class="slindent">For her love, then, incline thyself to us.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Permit us through thy sevenfold realm to go;</p>
<p class="slindent">I will take back this grace from thee to her,</p>
<p class="slindent">If to be mentioned there below thou deignest.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Marcia so pleasing was unto mine eyes</p>
<p class="slindent">While I was on the other side,&rdquo; then said he,</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;That every grace she wished of me I granted;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Now that she dwells beyond the evil river,</p>
<p class="slindent">She can no longer move me, by that law</p>
<p class="slindent">Which, when I issued forth from there, was made.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But if a Lady of Heaven do move and rule thee,</p>
<p class="slindent">As thou dost say, no flattery is needful;</p>
<p class="slindent">Let it suffice thee that for her thou ask me.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Go, then, and see thou gird this one about</p>
<p class="slindent">With a smooth rush, and that thou wash his face,</p>
<p class="slindent">So that thou cleanse away all stain therefrom,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>For &rsquo;twere not fitting that the eye o&rsquo;etcast</p>
<p class="slindent">By any mist should go before the first</p>
<p class="slindent">Angel, who is of those of Paradise.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>This little island round about its base</p>
<p class="slindent">Below there, yonder, where the billow beats it,</p>
<p class="slindent">Doth rushes bear upon its washy ooze;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>No other plant that putteth forth the leaf,</p>
<p class="slindent">Or that doth indurate, can there have life,</p>
<p class="slindent">Because it yieldeth not unto the shocks.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thereafter be not this way your return;</p>
<p class="slindent">The sun, which now is rising, will direct you</p>
<p class="slindent">To take the mount by easier ascent.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>With this he vanished; and I raised me up</p>
<p class="slindent">Without a word, and wholly drew myself</p>
<p class="slindent">Unto my Guide, and turned mine eyes to him.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And he began: &ldquo;Son, follow thou my steps;</p>
<p class="slindent">Let us turn back, for on this side declines</p>
<p class="slindent">The plain unto its lower boundaries.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The dawn was vanquishing the matin hour</p>
<p class="slindent">Which fled before it, so that from afar</p>
<p class="slindent">I recognised the trembling of the sea.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Along the solitary plain we went</p>
<p class="slindent">As one who unto the lost road returns,</p>
<p class="slindent">And till he finds it seems to go in vain.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>As soon as we were come to where the dew</p>
<p class="slindent">Fights with the sun, and, being in a part</p>
<p class="slindent">Where shadow falls, little evaporates,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Both of his hands upon the grass outspread</p>
<p class="slindent">In gentle manner did my Master place;</p>
<p class="slindent">Whence I, who of his action was aware,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Extended unto him my tearful cheeks;</p>
<p class="slindent">There did he make in me uncovered wholly</p>
<p class="slindent">That hue which Hell had covered up in me.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then came we down upon the desert shore</p>
<p class="slindent">Which never yet saw navigate its waters</p>
<p class="slindent">Any that afterward had known return.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>There he begirt me as the other pleased;</p>
<p class="slindent">O marvellous! for even as he culled</p>
<p class="slindent">The humble plant, such it sprang up again</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Suddenly there where he uprooted it.</p></div>`,

`<p class="cantohead">Purgatorio: Canto II</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>Already had the sun the horizon reached</p>
<p class="slindent">Whose circle of meridian covers o&rsquo;et</p>
<p class="slindent">Jerusalem with its most lofty point,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And night that opposite to him revolves</p>
<p class="slindent">Was issuing forth from Ganges with the Scales</p>
<p class="slindent">That fall from out her hand when she exceedeth;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So that the white and the vermilion cheeks</p>
<p class="slindent">Of beautiful Aurora, where I was,</p>
<p class="slindent">By too great age were changing into orange.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>We still were on the border of the sea,</p>
<p class="slindent">Like people who are thinking of their road,</p>
<p class="slindent">Who go in heart and with the body stay;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And lo! as when, upon the approach of morning,</p>
<p class="slindent">Through the gross vapours Mars grows fiery red</p>
<p class="slindent">Down in the West upon the ocean floor,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Appeared to me—may I again behold it!—</p>
<p class="slindent">A light along the sea so swiftly coming,</p>
<p class="slindent">Its motion by no flight of wing is equalled;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>From which when I a little had withdrawn</p>
<p class="slindent">Mine eyes, that I might question my Conductor,</p>
<p class="slindent">Again I saw it brighter grown and larger.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then on each side of it appeared to me</p>
<p class="slindent">I knew not what of white, and underneath it</p>
<p class="slindent">Little by little there came forth another.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>My Master yet had uttered not a word</p>
<p class="slindent">While the first whiteness into wings unfolded;</p>
<p class="slindent">But when he clearly recognised the pilot,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>He cried: &ldquo;Make haste, make haste to bow the knee!</p>
<p class="slindent">Behold the Angel of God! fold thou thy hands!</p>
<p class="slindent">Henceforward shalt thou see such officers!</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>See how he scorneth human arguments,</p>
<p class="slindent">So that nor oar he wants, nor other sail</p>
<p class="slindent">Than his own wings, between so distant shores.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>See how he holds them pointed up to heaven,</p>
<p class="slindent">Fanning the air with the eternal pinions,</p>
<p class="slindent">That do not moult themselves like mortal hair!&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then as still nearer and more near us came</p>
<p class="slindent">The Bird Divine, more radiant he appeared,</p>
<p class="slindent">So that near by the eye could not endure him,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But down I cast it; and he came to shore</p>
<p class="slindent">With a small vessel, very swift and light,</p>
<p class="slindent">So that the water swallowed naught thereof.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Upon the stern stood the Celestial Pilot;</p>
<p class="slindent">Beatitude seemed written in his face,</p>
<p class="slindent">And more than a hundred spirits sat within.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;In exitu Israel de Aegypto!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">They chanted all together in one voice,</p>
<p class="slindent">With whatso in that psalm is after written.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then made he sign of holy rood upon them,</p>
<p class="slindent">Whereat all cast themselves upon the shore,</p>
<p class="slindent">And he departed swiftly as he came.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The throng which still remained there unfamiliar</p>
<p class="slindent">Seemed with the place, all round about them gazing,</p>
<p class="slindent">As one who in new matters makes essay.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>On every side was darting forth the day.</p>
<p class="slindent">The sun, who had with his resplendent shafts</p>
<p class="slindent">From the mid-heaven chased forth the Capricorn,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>When the new people lifted up their faces</p>
<p class="slindent">Towards us, saying to us: &ldquo;If ye know,</p>
<p class="slindent">Show us the way to go unto the mountain.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And answer made Virgilius: &ldquo;Ye believe</p>
<p class="slindent">Perchance that we have knowledge of this place,</p>
<p class="slindent">But we are strangers even as yourselves.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Just now we came, a little while before you,</p>
<p class="slindent">Another way, which was so rough and steep,</p>
<p class="slindent">That mounting will henceforth seem sport to us.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The souls who had, from seeing me draw breath,</p>
<p class="slindent">Become aware that I was still alive,</p>
<p class="slindent">Pallid in their astonishment became;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And as to messenger who bears the olive</p>
<p class="slindent">The people throng to listen to the news,</p>
<p class="slindent">And no one shows himself afraid of crowding,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So at the sight of me stood motionless</p>
<p class="slindent">Those fortunate spirits, all of them, as if</p>
<p class="slindent">Oblivious to go and make them fair.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>One from among them saw I coming forward,</p>
<p class="slindent">As to embrace me, with such great affection,</p>
<p class="slindent">That it incited me to do the like.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>O empty shadows, save in aspect only!</p>
<p class="slindent">Three times behind it did I clasp my hands,</p>
<p class="slindent">As oft returned with them to my own breast!</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I think with wonder I depicted me;</p>
<p class="slindent">Whereat the shadow smiled and backward drew;</p>
<p class="slindent">And I, pursuing it, pressed farther forward.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Gently it said that I should stay my steps;</p>
<p class="slindent">Then knew I who it was, and I entreated</p>
<p class="slindent">That it would stop awhile to speak with me.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>It made reply to me: &ldquo;Even as I loved thee</p>
<p class="slindent">In mortal body, so I love thee free;</p>
<p class="slindent">Therefore I stop; but wherefore goest thou?&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;My own Casella! to return once more</p>
<p class="slindent">There where I am, I make this journey,&rdquo; said I;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;But how from thee has so much time be taken?&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And he to me: &ldquo;No outrage has been done me,</p>
<p class="slindent">If he who takes both when and whom he pleases</p>
<p class="slindent">Has many times denied to me this passage,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>For of a righteous will his own is made.</p>
<p class="slindent">He, sooth to say, for three months past has taken</p>
<p class="slindent">Whoever wished to enter with all peace;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Whence I, who now had turned unto that shore</p>
<p class="slindent">Where salt the waters of the Tiber grow,</p>
<p class="slindent">Benignantly by him have been received.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Unto that outlet now his wing is pointed,</p>
<p class="slindent">Because for evermore assemble there</p>
<p class="slindent">Those who tow&rsquo;rds Acheron do not descend.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And I: &ldquo;If some new law take not from thee</p>
<p class="slindent">Memory or practice of the song of love,</p>
<p class="slindent">Which used to quiet in me all my longings,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thee may it please to comfort therewithal</p>
<p class="slindent">Somewhat this soul of mine, that with its body</p>
<p class="slindent">Hitherward coming is so much distressed.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Love, that within my mind discourses with me,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Forthwith began he so melodiously,</p>
<p class="slindent">The melody within me still is sounding.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>My Master, and myself, and all that people</p>
<p class="slindent">Which with him were, appeared as satisfied</p>
<p class="slindent">As if naught else might touch the mind of any.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>We all of us were moveless and attentive</p>
<p class="slindent">Unto his notes; and lo! the grave old man,</p>
<p class="slindent">Exclaiming: &ldquo;What is this, ye laggard spirits?</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>What negligence, what standing still is this?</p>
<p class="slindent">Run to the mountain to strip off the slough,</p>
<p class="slindent">That lets not God be manifest to you.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Even as when, collecting grain or tares,</p>
<p class="slindent">The doves, together at their pasture met,</p>
<p class="slindent">Quiet, nor showing their accustomed pride,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>If aught appear of which they are afraid,</p>
<p class="slindent">Upon a sudden leave their food alone,</p>
<p class="slindent">Because they are assailed by greater care;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So that fresh company did I behold</p>
<p class="slindent">The song relinquish, and go tow&rsquo;rds the hill,</p>
<p class="slindent">As one who goes, and knows not whitherward;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Nor was our own departure less in haste.</p></div>`,

`<p class="cantohead">Purgatorio: Canto III</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>Inasmuch as the instantaneous flight</p>
<p class="slindent">Had scattered them asunder o&rsquo;et the plain,</p>
<p class="slindent">Turned to the mountain whither reason spurs us,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I pressed me close unto my faithful comrade,</p>
<p class="slindent">And how without him had I kept my course?</p>
<p class="slindent">Who would have led me up along the mountain?</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>He seemed to me within himself remorseful;</p>
<p class="slindent">O noble conscience, and without a stain,</p>
<p class="slindent">How sharp a sting is trivial fault to thee!</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>After his feet had laid aside the haste</p>
<p class="slindent">Which mars the dignity of every act,</p>
<p class="slindent">My mind, that hitherto had been restrained,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Let loose its faculties as if delighted,</p>
<p class="slindent">And I my sight directed to the hill</p>
<p class="slindent">That highest tow&rsquo;rds the heaven uplifts itself.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The sun, that in our rear was flaming red,</p>
<p class="slindent">Was broken in front of me into the figure</p>
<p class="slindent">Which had in me the stoppage of its rays;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Unto one side I turned me, with the fear</p>
<p class="slindent">Of being left alone, when I beheld</p>
<p class="slindent">Only in front of me the ground obscured.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Why dost thou still mistrust?&rdquo; my Comforter</p>
<p class="slindent">Began to say to me turned wholly round;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Dost thou not think me with thee, and that I guide thee?</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&rsquo;Tis evening there already where is buried</p>
<p class="slindent">The body within which I cast a shadow;</p>
<p class="slindent">&rsquo;Tis from Brundusium ta&rsquo;en, and Naples has it.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Now if in front of me no shadow fall,</p>
<p class="slindent">Marvel not at it more than at the heavens,</p>
<p class="slindent">Because one ray impedeth not another</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>To suffer torments, both of cold and heat,</p>
<p class="slindent">Bodies like this that Power provides, which wills</p>
<p class="slindent">That how it works be not unveiled to us.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Insane is he who hopeth that our reason</p>
<p class="slindent">Can traverse the illimitable way,</p>
<p class="slindent">Which the one Substance in three Persons follows!</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Mortals, remain contented at the &lsquo;Quia;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">For if ye had been able to see all,</p>
<p class="slindent">No need there were for Mary to give birth;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And ye have seen desiring without fruit,</p>
<p class="slindent">Those whose desire would have been quieted,</p>
<p class="slindent">Which evermore is given them for a grief.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I speak of Aristotle and of Plato,</p>
<p class="slindent">And many others;&rdquo;&mdash;and here bowed his head,</p>
<p class="slindent">And more he said not, and remained disturbed.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>We came meanwhile unto the mountain&rsquo;s foot;</p>
<p class="slindent">There so precipitate we found the rock,</p>
<p class="slindent">That nimble legs would there have been in vain.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&rsquo;Twixt Lerici and Turbia, the most desert,</p>
<p class="slindent">The most secluded pathway is a stair</p>
<p class="slindent">Easy and open, if compared with that.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Who knoweth now upon which hand the hill</p>
<p class="slindent">Slopes down,&rdquo; my Master said, his footsteps staying,</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;So that who goeth without wings may mount?&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And while he held his eyes upon the ground</p>
<p class="slindent">Examining the nature of the path,</p>
<p class="slindent">And I was looking up around the rock,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>On the left hand appeared to me a throng</p>
<p class="slindent">Of souls, that moved their feet in our direction,</p>
<p class="slindent">And did not seem to move, they came so slowly.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Lift up thine eyes,&rdquo; I to the Master said;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Behold, on this side, who will give us counsel,</p>
<p class="slindent">If thou of thine own self can have it not.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then he looked at me, and with frank expression</p>
<p class="slindent">Replied: &ldquo;Let us go there, for they come slowly,</p>
<p class="slindent">And thou be steadfast in thy hope, sweet son.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Still was that people as far off from us,</p>
<p class="slindent">After a thousand steps of ours I say,</p>
<p class="slindent">As a good thrower with his hand would reach,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>When they all crowded unto the hard masses</p>
<p class="slindent">Of the high bank, and motionless stood and close,</p>
<p class="slindent">As he stands still to look who goes in doubt.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;O happy dead!  O spirits elect already!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Virgilius made beginning, &ldquo;by that peace</p>
<p class="slindent">Which I believe is waiting for you all,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Tell us upon what side the mountain slopes,</p>
<p class="slindent">So that the going up be possible,</p>
<p class="slindent">For to lose time irks him most who most knows.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>As sheep come issuing forth from out the fold</p>
<p class="slindent">By ones and twos and threes, and the others stand</p>
<p class="slindent">Timidly, holding down their eyes and nostrils,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And what the foremost does the others do,</p>
<p class="slindent">Huddling themselves against her, if she stop,</p>
<p class="slindent">Simple and quiet and the wherefore know not;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So moving to approach us thereupon</p>

<p class="slindent">The light upon the ground at my right side,</p>
<p class="slindent">So that from me the shadow reached the rock,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>They stopped, and backward drew themselves somewhat;</p>

<p class="slindent">If e&rsquo;et thou saw me in the other world.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I turned me tow&rsquo;rds him, and looked at him closely;</p>
<p class="slindent">Blond was he, beautiful, and of noble aspect,</p>
<p class="slindent">But one of his eyebrows had a blow divided.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>When with humility I had disclaimed</p>
<p class="slindent">E&rsquo;et having seen him, &ldquo;Now behold!&rdquo; he said,</p>
<p class="slindent">And showed me high upon his breast a wound.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then said he with a smile: &ldquo;I am Manfredi,</p>

<p class="slindent">Pointing me to a terrace somewhat higher,</p>
<p class="slindent">Which on that side encircles all the hill.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>These words of his so spurred me on, that I</p>
<p class="slindent">Strained every nerve, behind him scrambling up,</p>
<p class="slindent">Until the circle was beneath my feet.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So that they both one sole horizon have,</p>
<p class="slindent">And hemispheres diverse; whereby the road</p>
<p class="slindent">Which Phaeton, alas! knew not to drive,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thou&rsquo;lt see how of necessity must pass</p>
<p class="slindent">This on one side, when that upon the other,</p>
<p class="slindent">If thine intelligence right clearly heed.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Truly, my Master,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;never yet</p>
<p class="slindent">Saw I so clearly as I now discern,</p>
<p class="slindent">There where my wit appeared incompetent,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>That the mid-circle of supernal motion,</p>

<p class="slindent">Tow&rsquo;rds the Septentrion, what time the Hebrews</p>
<p class="slindent">Beheld it tow&rsquo;rds the region of the heat.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But, if it pleaseth thee, I fain would learn</p>
<p class="slindent">How far we have to go; for the hill rises</p>
<p class="slindent">Higher than eyes of mine have power to rise.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And he to me: &ldquo;This mount is such, that ever</p>
<p class="slindent">At the beginning down below &rsquo;tis tiresome,</p>
<p class="slindent">And aye the more one climbs, the less it hurts.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Therefore, when it shall seem so pleasant to thee,</p>
<p class="slindent">That going up shall be to thee as easy</p>
<p class="slindent">As going down the current in a boat,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then at this pathway&rsquo;s ending thou wilt be;</p>
<p class="slindent">There to repose thy panting breath expect;</p>
<p class="slindent">No more I answer; and this I know for true.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And as he finished uttering these words,</p>
<p class="slindent">A voice close by us sounded: &ldquo;Peradventure</p>
<p class="slindent">Thou wilt have need of sitting down ere that.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>At sound thereof each one of us turned round,</p>
<p class="slindent">And saw upon the left hand a great rock,</p>
<p class="slindent">Which neither I nor he before had noticed.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thither we drew; and there were persons there</p>
<p class="slindent">Who in the shadow stood behind the rock,</p>
<p class="slindent">As one through indolence is wont to stand.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And one of them, who seemed to me fatigued,</p>
<p class="slindent">Was sitting down, and both his knees embraced,</p>
<p class="slindent">Holding his face low down between them bowed.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;O my sweet Lord,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;do turn thine eye</p>
<p class="slindent">On him who shows himself more negligent</p>
<p class="slindent">Then even Sloth herself his sister were.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then he turned round to us, and he gave heed,</p>
<p class="slindent">Just lifting up his eyes above his thigh,</p>
<p class="slindent">And said: &ldquo;Now go thou up, for thou art valiant.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then knew I who he was; and the distress,</p>
<p class="slindent">That still a little did my breathing quicken,</p>
<p class="slindent">My going to him hindered not; and after</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I came to him he hardly raised his head,</p>
<p class="slindent">Saying: &ldquo;Hast thou seen clearly how the sun</p>
<p class="slindent">O&rsquo;et thy left shoulder drives his chariot?&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>His sluggish attitude and his curt words</p>
<p class="slindent">A little unto laughter moved my lips;</p>
<p class="slindent">Then I began: &ldquo;Belacqua, I grieve not</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>For thee henceforth; but tell me, wherefore seated</p>
<p class="slindent">In this place art thou?  Waitest thou an escort?</p>
<p class="slindent">Or has thy usual habit seized upon thee?&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And he: &ldquo;O brother, what&rsquo;s the use of climbing?</p>
<p class="slindent">Since to my torment would not let me go</p>
<p class="slindent">The Angel of God, who sitteth at the gate.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>First heaven must needs so long revolve me round</p>
<p class="slindent">Outside thereof, as in my life it did,</p>
<p class="slindent">Since the good sighs I to the end postponed,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Unless, e&rsquo;et that, some prayer may bring me aid</p>
<p class="slindent">Which rises from a heart that lives in grace;</p>
<p class="slindent">What profit others that in heaven are heard not?&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Meanwhile the Poet was before me mounting,</p>
<p class="slindent">And saying: &ldquo;Come now; see the sun has touched</p>
<p class="slindent">Meridian, and from the shore the night</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Covers already with her foot Morocco.&rdquo;</p></div>`,

`<p class="cantohead">Purgatorio: Canto V</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>I had already from those shades departed,</p>
<p class="slindent">And followed in the footsteps of my Guide,</p>
<p class="slindent">When from behind, pointing his finger at me,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>One shouted: &ldquo;See, it seems as if shone not</p>
<p class="slindent">The sunshine on the left of him below,</p>
<p class="slindent">And like one living seems he to conduct him.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Mine eyes I turned at utterance of these words,</p>
<p class="slindent">And saw them watching with astonishment</p>
<p class="slindent">But me, but me, and the light which was broken!</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Why doth thy mind so occupy itself,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">The Master said, &ldquo;that thou thy pace dost slacken?</p>
<p class="slindent">What matters it to thee what here is whispered?</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Come after me, and let the people talk;</p>
<p class="slindent">Stand like a steadfast tower, that never wags</p>
<p class="slindent">Its top for all the blowing of the winds;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>For evermore the man in whom is springing</p>
<p class="slindent">Thought upon thought, removes from him the mark,</p>
<p class="slindent">Because the force of one the other weakens.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>What could I say in answer but &ldquo;I come&rdquo;?</p>
<p class="slindent">I said it somewhat with that colour tinged</p>
<p class="slindent">Which makes a man of pardon sometimes worthy.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Meanwhile along the mountain-side across</p>
<p class="slindent">Came people in advance of us a little,</p>
<p class="slindent">Singing the Miserere verse by verse.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>When they became aware I gave no place</p>
<p class="slindent">For passage of the sunshine through my body,</p>
<p class="slindent">They changed their song into a long, hoarse &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And two of them, in form of messengers,</p>
<p class="slindent">Ran forth to meet us, and demanded of us,</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Of your condition make us cognisant.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And said my Master: &ldquo;Ye can go your way</p>
<p class="slindent">And carry back again to those who sent you,</p>
<p class="slindent">That this one&rsquo;s body is of very flesh.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>If they stood still because they saw his shadow,</p>
<p class="slindent">As I suppose, enough is answered them;</p>
<p class="slindent">Him let them honour, it may profit them.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Vapours enkindled saw I ne&rsquo;et so swiftly</p>
<p class="slindent">At early nightfall cleave the air serene,</p>
<p class="slindent">Nor, at the set of sun, the clouds of August,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But upward they returned in briefer time,</p>
<p class="slindent">And, on arriving, with the others wheeled</p>
<p class="slindent">Tow&rsquo;rds us, like troops that run without a rein.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;This folk that presses unto us is great,</p>
<p class="slindent">And cometh to implore thee,&rdquo; said the Poet;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;So still go onward, and in going listen.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;O soul that goest to beatitude</p>
<p class="slindent">With the same members wherewith thou wast born,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Shouting they came, &ldquo;a little stay thy steps,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Look, if thou e&rsquo;et hast any of us seen,</p>
<p class="slindent">So that o&rsquo;et yonder thou bear news of him;</p>
<p class="slindent">Ah, why dost thou go on?  Ah, why not stay?</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Long since we all were slain by violence,</p>
<p class="slindent">And sinners even to the latest hour;</p>
<p class="slindent">Then did a light from heaven admonish us,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So that, both penitent and pardoning, forth</p>
<p class="slindent">From life we issued reconciled to God,</p>
<p class="slindent">Who with desire to see Him stirs our hearts.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And I: &ldquo;Although I gaze into your faces,</p>
<p class="slindent">No one I recognize; but if may please you</p>
<p class="slindent">Aught I have power to do, ye well-born spirits,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Speak ye, and I will do it, by that peace</p>
<p class="slindent">Which, following the feet of such a Guide,</p>
<p class="slindent">From world to world makes itself sought by me.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And one began: &ldquo;Each one has confidence</p>
<p class="slindent">In thy good offices without an oath,</p>
<p class="slindent">Unless the I cannot cut off the I will;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Whence I, who speak alone before the others,</p>
<p class="slindent">Pray thee, if ever thou dost see the land</p>
<p class="slindent">That &rsquo;twixt Romagna lies and that of Charles,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thou be so courteous to me of thy prayers</p>
<p class="slindent">In Fano, that they pray for me devoutly,</p>
<p class="slindent">That I may purge away my grave offences.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>From thence was I; but the deep wounds, through which</p>
<p class="slindent">Issued the blood wherein I had my seat,</p>
<p class="slindent">Were dealt me in bosom of the Antenori,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>There where I thought to be the most secure;</p>
<p class="slindent">&rsquo;Twas he of Este had it done, who held me</p>
<p class="slindent">In hatred far beyond what justice willed.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But if towards the Mira I had fled,</p>
<p class="slindent">When I was overtaken at Oriaco,</p>
<p class="slindent">I still should be o&rsquo;et yonder where men breathe.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I ran to the lagoon, and reeds and mire</p>
<p class="slindent">Did so entangle me I fell, and saw there</p>
<p class="slindent">A lake made from my veins upon the ground.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then said another: &ldquo;Ah, be that desire</p>
<p class="slindent">Fulfilled that draws thee to the lofty mountain,</p>

<p class="slindent">Giovanna, nor none other cares for me;</p>
<p class="slindent">Hence among these I go with downcast front.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And I to him: &ldquo;What violence or what chance</p>
<p class="slindent">Led thee astray so far from Campaldino,</p>
<p class="slindent">That never has thy sepulture been known?&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;at Casentino&rsquo;s foot</p>

<p class="slindent">Above the Hermitage in Apennine.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>There where the name thereof becometh void</p>
<p class="slindent">Did I arrive, pierced through and through the throat,</p>
<p class="slindent">Fleeing on foot, and bloodying the plain;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>There my sight lost I, and my utterance</p>
<p class="slindent">Ceased in the name of Mary, and thereat</p>
<p class="slindent">I fell, and tenantless my flesh remained.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Truth will I speak, repeat it to the living;</p>
<p class="slindent">God&rsquo;s Angel took me up, and he of hell</p>
<p class="slindent">Shouted: &lsquo;O thou from heaven, why dost thou rob me?</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thou bearest away the eternal part of him,</p>
<p class="slindent">For one poor little tear, that takes him from me;</p>

<p class="slindent">By means of power, which his own nature gave;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thereafter, when the day was spent, the valley</p>
<p class="slindent">From Pratomagno to the great yoke covered</p>
<p class="slindent">With fog, and made the heaven above intent,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And as it mingled with the mighty torrents,</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>Only three steps I think that I descended,</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then, turned to me: &ldquo;By that especial grace</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>Ashes, or earth that dry is excavated,</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>At the first thunder-peal I turned attentive,</p>
<p class="slindent">And &ldquo;Te Deum laudamus&rdquo; seemed to hear</p>
<p class="slindent">In voices mingled with sweet melody.</p></div>

<p class="slindent">But for their sake who have remained behind us.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thus for themselves and us good furtherance</p>
<p class="slindent">Those shades imploring, went beneath a weight</p>
<p class="slindent">Like unto that of which we sometimes dream,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Unequally in anguish round and round</p>
<p class="slindent">And weary all, upon that foremost cornice,</p>
<p class="slindent">Purging away the smoke-stains of the world.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>If there good words are always said for us,</p>
<p class="slindent">What may not here be said and done for them,</p>
<p class="slindent">By those who have a good root to their will?</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Well may we help them wash away the marks</p>
<p class="slindent">That hence they carried, so that clean and light</p>
<p class="slindent">They may ascend unto the starry wheels!</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Ah! so may pity and justice you disburden</p>

<p class="slindent">Is shortest, and if more than one the passes,</p>
<p class="slindent">Point us out that which least abruptly falls;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>For he who cometh with me, through the burden</p>
<p class="slindent">Of Adam&rsquo;s flesh wherewith he is invested,</p>
<p class="slindent">Against his will is chary of his climbing.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The words of theirs which they returned to those</p>
<p class="slindent">That he whom I was following had spoken,</p>
<p class="slindent">It was not manifest from whom they came,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But it was said: &ldquo;To the right hand come with us</p>
<p class="slindent">Along the bank, and ye shall find a pass</p>
<p class="slindent">Possible for living person to ascend.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And were I not impeded by the stone,</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>Him, who still lives and does not name himself,</p>
<p class="slindent">Would I regard, to see if I may know him</p>
<p class="slindent">And make him piteous unto this burden.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>A Latian was I, and born of a great Tuscan;</p>
<p class="slindent">Guglielmo Aldobrandeschi was my father;</p>
<p class="slindent">I know not if his name were ever with you.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The ancient blood and deeds of gallantry</p>
<p class="slindent">Of my progenitors so arrogant made me</p>
<p class="slindent">That, thinking not upon the common mother,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>All men I held in scorn to such extent</p>
<p class="slindent">I died therefor, as know the Sienese,</p>
<p class="slindent">And every child in Campagnatico.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I am Omberto; and not to me alone</p>
<p class="slindent">Has pride done harm, but all my kith and kin</p>
<p class="slindent">Has with it dragged into adversity.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And here must I this burden bear for it</p>
<p class="slindent">Till God be satisfied, since I did not</p>
<p class="slindent">Among the living, here among the dead.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Listening I downward bent my countenance;</p>
<p class="slindent">And one of them, not this one who was speaking,</p>
<p class="slindent">Twisted himself beneath the weight that cramps him,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And looked at me, and knew me, and called out,</p>
<p class="slindent">Keeping his eyes laboriously fixed</p>
<p class="slindent">On me, who all bowed down was going with them.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;O,&rdquo; asked I him, &ldquo;art thou not Oderisi,</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>In sooth I had not been so courteous</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>O thou vain glory of the human powers,</p>
<p class="slindent">How little green upon thy summit lingers,</p>
<p class="slindent">If&rsquo;t be not followed by an age of grossness!</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>In painting Cimabue thought that he</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;is Provenzan Salvani,</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>I say no more, and know that I speak darkly;</p>

`<p class="cantohead">Purgatorio: Canto XII</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>Abreast, like oxen going in a yoke,</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>Upright, as walking wills it, I redressed</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>So saw I there, but of a better semblance</p>
<p class="slindent">In point of artifice, with figures covered</p>
<p class="slindent">Whate&rsquo;et as pathway from the mount projects.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Displayed how routed fled the Assyrians</p>
<p class="slindent">After that Holofernes had been slain,</p>
<p class="slindent">And likewise the remainder of that slaughter.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>When he, who ever watchful in advance</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>Towards us came the being beautiful</p>
<p class="slindent">Vested in white, and in his countenance</p>
<p class="slindent">Such as appears the tremulous morning star.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>His arms he opened, and opened then his wings;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;near at hand here are the steps,</p>
<p class="slindent">And easy from henceforth is the ascent.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>At this announcement few are they who come!</p>
<p class="slindent">O human creatures, born to soar aloft,</p>
<p class="slindent">Why fall ye thus before a little wind?</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>He led us on to where the rock was cleft;</p>
<p class="slindent">There smote upon my forehead with his wings,</p>
<p class="slindent">Then a safe passage promised unto me.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>As on the right hand, to ascend the mount</p>
<p class="slindent">Where seated is the church that lordeth it</p>
<p class="slindent">O&rsquo;et the well-guided, above Rubaconte,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The bold abruptness of the ascent is broken</p>
<p class="slindent">By stairways that were made there in the age</p>
<p class="slindent">When still were safe the ledger and the stave,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>E&rsquo;en thus attempered is the bank which falls</p>
<p class="slindent">Sheer downward from the second circle there;</p>
<p class="slindent">But on this, side and that the high rock graze.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>As we were turning thitherward our persons,</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Beati pauperes spiritu,&rdquo; voices</p>
<p class="slindent">Sang in such wise that speech could tell it not.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Ah me! how different are these entrances</p>
<p class="slindent">From the Infernal! for with anthems here</p>
<p class="slindent">One enters, and below with wild laments.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>We now were hunting up the sacred stairs,</p>
<p class="slindent">And it appeared to me by far more easy</p>
<p class="slindent">Than on the plain it had appeared before.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Whence I: &ldquo;My Master, say, what heavy thing</p>
<p class="slindent">Has been uplifted from me, so that hardly</p>
<p class="slindent">Aught of fatigue is felt by me in walking?&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>He answered: &ldquo;When the P&rsquo;s which have remained</p>
<p class="slindent">Still on thy face almost obliterate</p>
<p class="slindent">Shall wholly, as the first is, be erased,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thy feet will be so vanquished by good will,</p>
<p class="slindent">That not alone they shall not feel fatigue,</p>
<p class="slindent">But urging up will be to them delight.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then did I even as they do who are going</p>
<p class="slindent">With something on the head to them unknown,</p>
<p class="slindent">Unless the signs of others make them doubt,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Wherefore the hand to ascertain is helpful,</p>
<p class="slindent">And seeks and finds, and doth fulfill the office</p>
<p class="slindent">Which cannot be accomplished by the sight;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And with the fingers of the right hand spread</p>
<p class="slindent">I found but six the letters, that had carved</p>
<p class="slindent">Upon my temples he who bore the keys;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Upon beholding which my Leader smiled.</p></div>`,

`<p class="cantohead">Purgatorio: Canto XIII</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>We were upon the summit of the stairs,</p>
<p class="slindent">Where for the second time is cut away</p>
<p class="slindent">The mountain, which ascending shriveth all.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>There in like manner doth a cornice bind</p>
<p class="slindent">The hill all round about, as does the first,</p>
<p class="slindent">Save that its arc more suddenly is curved.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Shade is there none, nor sculpture that appears;</p>
<p class="slindent">So seems the bank, and so the road seems smooth,</p>
<p class="slindent">With but the livid colour of the stone.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;If to inquire we wait for people here,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">The Poet said, &ldquo;I fear that peradventure</p>
<p class="slindent">Too much delay will our election have.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then steadfast on the sun his eyes he fixed,</p>
<p class="slindent">Made his right side the centre of his motion,</p>
<p class="slindent">And turned the left part of himself about.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;O thou sweet light! with trust in whom I enter</p>
<p class="slindent">Upon this novel journey, do thou lead us,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Said he, &ldquo;as one within here should be led.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thou warmest the world, thou shinest over it;</p>
<p class="slindent">If other reason prompt not otherwise,</p>
<p class="slindent">Thy rays should evermore our leaders be!&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>As much as here is counted for a mile,</p>
<p class="slindent">So much already there had we advanced</p>
<p class="slindent">In little time, by dint of ready will;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And tow&rsquo;rds us there were heard to fly, albeit</p>
<p class="slindent">They were not visible, spirits uttering</p>
<p class="slindent">Unto Love&rsquo;s table courteous invitations,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The first voice that passed onward in its flight,</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Vinum non habent,&rdquo; said in accents loud,</p>
<p class="slindent">And went reiterating it behind us.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And ere it wholly grew inaudible</p>
<p class="slindent">Because of distance, passed another, crying,</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;I am Orestes!&rdquo; and it also stayed not.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;O,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;Father, these, what voices are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">And even as I asked, behold the third,</p>
<p class="slindent">Saying: &ldquo;Love those from whom ye have had evil!&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And the good Master said: &ldquo;This circle scourges</p>
<p class="slindent">The sin of envy, and on that account</p>
<p class="slindent">Are drawn from love the lashes of the scourge.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The bridle of another sound shall be;</p>
<p class="slindent">I think that thou wilt hear it, as I judge,</p>
<p class="slindent">Before thou comest to the Pass of Pardon.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But fix thine eyes athwart the air right steadfast,</p>
<p class="slindent">And people thou wilt see before us sitting,</p>
<p class="slindent">And each one close against the cliff is seated.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then wider than at first mine eyes I opened;</p>
<p class="slindent">I looked before me, and saw shades with mantles</p>
<p class="slindent">Not from the colour of the stone diverse.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And when we were a little farther onward,</p>
<p class="slindent">I heard a cry of, &ldquo;Mary, pray for us!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">A cry of, &ldquo;Michael, Peter, and all Saints!&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I do not think there walketh still on earth</p>
<p class="slindent">A man so hard, that he would not be pierced</p>
<p class="slindent">With pity at what afterward I saw.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>For when I had approached so near to them</p>
<p class="slindent">That manifest to me their acts became,</p>
<p class="slindent">Drained was I at the eyes by heavy grief.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Covered with sackcloth vile they seemed to me,</p>
<p class="slindent">And one sustained the other with his shoulder,</p>
<p class="slindent">And all of them were by the bank sustained.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thus do the blind, in want of livelihood,</p>
<p class="slindent">Stand at the doors of churches asking alms,</p>
<p class="slindent">And one upon another leans his head,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So that in others pity soon may rise,</p>
<p class="slindent">Not only at the accent of their words,</p>
<p class="slindent">But at their aspect, which no less implores.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And as unto the blind the sun comes not,</p>
<p class="slindent">So to the shades, of whom just now I spake,</p>
<p class="slindent">Heaven&rsquo;s light will not be bounteous of itself;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>For all their lids an iron wire transpierces,</p>
<p class="slindent">And sews them up, as to a sparhawk wild</p>
<p class="slindent">Is done, because it will not quiet stay.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>To me it seemed, in passing, to do outrage,</p>
<p class="slindent">Seeing the others without being seen;</p>
<p class="slindent">Wherefore I turned me to my counsel sage.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Well knew he what the mute one wished to say,</p>
<p class="slindent">And therefore waited not for my demand,</p>
<p class="slindent">But said: &ldquo;Speak, and be brief, and to the point.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I had Virgilius upon that side</p>
<p class="slindent">Of the embankment from which one may fall,</p>
<p class="slindent">Since by no border &rsquo;tis engarlanded;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Upon the other side of me I had</p>
<p class="slindent">The shades devout, who through the horrible seam</p>
<p class="slindent">Pressed out the tears so that they bathed their cheeks.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>To them I turned me, and, &ldquo;O people, certain,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Began I, &ldquo;of beholding the high light,</p>
<p class="slindent">Which your desire has solely in its care,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So may grace speedily dissolve the scum</p>
<p class="slindent">Upon your consciences, that limpidly</p>
<p class="slindent">Through them descend the river of the mind,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Tell me, for dear &rsquo;twill be to me and gracious,</p>
<p class="slindent">If any soul among you here is Latian,</p>
<p class="slindent">And &rsquo;twill perchance be good for him I learn it.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;O brother mine, each one is citizen</p>
<p class="slindent">Of one true city; but thy meaning is,</p>
<p class="slindent">Who may have lived in Italy a pilgrim.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>By way of answer this I seemed to hear</p>
<p class="slindent">A little farther on than where I stood,</p>
<p class="slindent">Whereat I made myself still nearer heard.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Among the rest I saw a shade that waited</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>So much it now appeared, towards the night,</p>
<p class="slindent">Was of his course remaining to the sun;</p>
<p class="slindent">There it was evening, and &rsquo;twas midnight here;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And the rays smote the middle of our faces,</p>
<p class="slindent">Because by us the mount was so encircled,</p>
<p class="slindent">That straight towards the west we now were going</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>When I perceived my forehead overpowered</p>
<p class="slindent">Beneath the splendour far more than at first,</p>
<p class="slindent">And stupor were to me the things unknown,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Whereat towards the summit of my brow</p>
<p class="slindent">I raised my hands, and made myself the visor</p>

<p class="slindent">Refracted there before me I was smitten;</p>
<p class="slindent">On which account my sight was swift to flee.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;What is that, Father sweet, from which I cannot</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>My Master and myself, we two alone</p>

<p class="slindent">I said, &ldquo;than if I had before been silent,</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>And the more people thitherward aspire,</p>
<p class="slindent">More are there to love well, and more they love there,</p>
<p class="slindent">And, as a mirror, one reflects the other.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>There it appeared to me that in a vision</p>
<p class="slindent">Ecstatic on a sudden I was rapt,</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>Lo, sorrowing, thy father and myself</p>
<p class="slindent">Were seeking for thee;&rdquo;&mdash;and as here she ceased,</p>
<p class="slindent">That which appeared at first had disappeared.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then I beheld another with those waters</p>
<p class="slindent">Adown her cheeks which grief distils whenever</p>
<p class="slindent">From great disdain of others it is born,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And saying: &ldquo;If of that city thou art lord,</p>
<p class="slindent">For whose name was such strife among the gods,</p>
<p class="slindent">And whence doth every science scintillate,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Avenge thyself on those audacious arms</p>
<p class="slindent">That clasped our daughter, O Pisistratus;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">And the lord seemed to me benign and mild</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>To answer her with aspect temperate:</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;What shall we do to those who wish us ill,</p>
<p class="slindent">If he who loves us be by us condemned?&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then saw I people hot in fire of wrath,</p>
<p class="slindent">With stones a young man slaying, clamorously</p>
<p class="slindent">Still crying to each other, &ldquo;Kill him! kill him!&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And him I saw bow down, because of death</p>
<p class="slindent">That weighed already on him, to the earth,</p>
<p class="slindent">But of his eyes made ever gates to heaven,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Imploring the high Lord, in so great strife,</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;O my sweet Father, if thou listen to me,</p>
<p class="slindent">I&rsquo;ll tell thee,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what appeared to me,</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>We passed along, athwart the twilight peering</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>For not an eye it suffered to stay open;</p>
<p class="slindent">Whereat mine escort, faithful and sagacious,</p>
<p class="slindent">Drew near to me and offered me his shoulder.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>E&rsquo;en as a blind man goes behind his guide,</p>
<p class="slindent">Lest he should wander, or should strike against</p>
<p class="slindent">Aught that may harm or peradventure kill him,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So went I through the bitter and foul air,</p>
<p class="slindent">Listening unto my Leader, who said only,</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Look that from me thou be not separated.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Voices I heard, and every one appeared</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Master,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;are spirits those I hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">And he to me: &ldquo;Thou apprehendest truly,</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Now who art thou, that cleavest through our smoke</p>
<p class="slindent">And art discoursing of us even as though</p>
<p class="slindent">Thou didst by calends still divide the time?&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>After this manner by a voice was spoken;</p>
<p class="slindent">Whereon my Master said: &ldquo;Do thou reply,</p>
<p class="slindent">And ask if on this side the way go upward.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And I: &ldquo;O creature that dost cleanse thyself</p>
<p class="slindent">To return beautiful to Him who made thee,</p>
<p class="slindent">Thou shalt hear marvels if thou follow me.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Thee will I follow far as is allowed me,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">He answered; &ldquo;and if smoke prevent our seeing,</p>
<p class="slindent">Hearing shall keep us joined instead thereof.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thereon began I: &ldquo;With that swathing band</p>

<p class="slindent">And hither came I through the infernal anguish.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And if God in his grace has me infolded,</p>
<p class="slindent">So that he wills that I behold his court</p>
<p class="slindent">By method wholly out of modern usage,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Conceal not from me who ere death thou wast,</p>

<p class="slindent">Thus he made answer, and subjoined: &ldquo;I pray thee</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>And I to him: &ldquo;My faith I pledge to thee</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>Ye who are living every cause refer</p>

<p class="slindent">Confounding in itself two governments,</p>
<p class="slindent">Falls in the mire, and soils itself and burden.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;O Marco mine,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;thou reasonest well;</p>

<p class="slindent">Have been excluded from the heritage.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But what Gherardo is it, who, as sample</p>
<p class="slindent">Of a lost race, thou sayest has remained</p>
<p class="slindent">In reprobation of the barbarous age?&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Either thy speech deceives me, or it tempts me,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">He answered me; &ldquo;for speaking Tuscan to me,</p>
<p class="slindent">It seems of good Gherardo naught thou knowest.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thus did he speak, and would no farther hear me.</p></div>`,

`<p class="cantohead">Purgatorio: Canto XVII</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>Remember, Reader, if e&rsquo;et in the Alps</p>
<p class="slindent">A mist o&rsquo;ettook thee, through which thou couldst see</p>
<p class="slindent">Not otherwise than through its membrane mole,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>How, when the vapours humid and condensed</p>
<p class="slindent">Begin to dissipate themselves, the sphere</p>
<p class="slindent">Of the sun feebly enters in among them,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And thy imagination will be swift</p>
<p class="slindent">In coming to perceive how I re-saw</p>
<p class="slindent">The sun at first, that was already setting.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thus, to the faithful footsteps of my Master</p>
<p class="slindent">Mating mine own, I issued from that cloud</p>
<p class="slindent">To rays already dead on the low shores.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>O thou, Imagination, that dost steal us</p>
<p class="slindent">So from without sometimes, that man perceives not,</p>
<p class="slindent">Although around may sound a thousand trumpets,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Who moveth thee, if sense impel thee not?</p>
<p class="slindent">Moves thee a light, which in the heaven takes form,</p>
<p class="slindent">By self, or by a will that downward guides it.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Of her impiety, who changed her form</p>
<p class="slindent">Into the bird that most delights in singing,</p>
<p class="slindent">In my imagining appeared the trace;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And hereupon my mind was so withdrawn</p>
<p class="slindent">Within itself, that from without there came</p>
<p class="slindent">Nothing that then might be received by it.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then reigned within my lofty fantasy</p>
<p class="slindent">One crucified, disdainful and ferocious</p>
<p class="slindent">In countenance, and even thus was dying.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Around him were the great Ahasuerus,</p>
<p class="slindent">Esther his wife, and the just Mordecai,</p>
<p class="slindent">Who was in word and action so entire.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And even as this image burst asunder</p>
<p class="slindent">Of its own self, in fashion of a bubble</p>
<p class="slindent">In which the water it was made of fails,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>There rose up in my vision a young maiden</p>
<p class="slindent">Bitterly weeping, and she said: &ldquo;O queen,</p>
<p class="slindent">Why hast thou wished in anger to be naught?</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thou&rsquo;st slain thyself, Lavinia not to lose;</p>
<p class="slindent">Now hast thou lost me; I am she who mourns,</p>
<p class="slindent">Mother, at thine ere at another&rsquo;s ruin.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>As sleep is broken, when upon a sudden</p>
<p class="slindent">New light strikes in upon the eyelids closed,</p>
<p class="slindent">And broken quivers ere it dieth wholly,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So this imagining of mine fell down</p>
<p class="slindent">As soon as the effulgence smote my face,</p>
<p class="slindent">Greater by far than what is in our wont.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I turned me round to see where I might be,</p>
<p class="slindent">When said a voice, &ldquo;Here is the passage up;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Which from all other purposes removed me,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And made my wish so full of eagerness</p>
<p class="slindent">To look and see who was it that was speaking,</p>
<p class="slindent">It never rests till meeting face to face;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But as before the sun, which quells the sight,</p>
<p class="slindent">And in its own excess its figure veils,</p>
<p class="slindent">Even so my power was insufficient here.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;This is a spirit divine, who in the way</p>
<p class="slindent">Of going up directs us without asking,</p>
<p class="slindent">And who with his own light himself conceals.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>He does with us as man doth with himself;</p>
<p class="slindent">For he who sees the need, and waits the asking,</p>
<p class="slindent">Malignly leans already tow&rsquo;rds denial.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Accord we now our feet to such inviting,</p>
<p class="slindent">Let us make haste to mount ere it grow dark;</p>
<p class="slindent">For then we could not till the day return.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thus my Conductor said; and I and he</p>
<p class="slindent">Together turned our footsteps to a stairway;</p>
<p class="slindent">And I, as soon as the first step I reached,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Near me perceived a motion as of wings,</p>
<p class="slindent">And fanning in the face, and saying, &ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;Beati</p>
<p class="slindent">Pacifici,&rsquo; who are without ill anger.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Already over us were so uplifted</p>
<p class="slindent">The latest sunbeams, which the night pursues,</p>
<p class="slindent">That upon many sides the stars appeared.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;O manhood mine, why dost thou vanish so?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">I said within myself; for I perceived</p>
<p class="slindent">The vigour of my legs was put in truce.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>We at the point were where no more ascends</p>
<p class="slindent">The stairway upward, and were motionless,</p>
<p class="slindent">Even as a ship, which at the shore arrives;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And I gave heed a little, if I might hear</p>
<p class="slindent">Aught whatsoever in the circle new;</p>
<p class="slindent">Then to my Master turned me round and said:</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Say, my sweet Father, what delinquency</p>
<p class="slindent">Is purged here in the circle where we are?</p>
<p class="slindent">Although our feet may pause, pause not thy speech.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And he to me: &ldquo;The love of good, remiss</p>
<p class="slindent">In what it should have done, is here restored;</p>
<p class="slindent">Here plied again the ill-belated oar;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But still more openly to understand,</p>
<p class="slindent">Turn unto me thy mind, and thou shalt gather</p>
<p class="slindent">Some profitable fruit from our delay.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Neither Creator nor a creature ever,</p>
<p class="slindent">Son,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;was destitute of love</p>
<p class="slindent">Natural or spiritual; and thou knowest it.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The natural was ever without error;</p>
<p class="slindent">But err the other may by evil object,</p>
<p class="slindent">Or by too much, or by too little vigour.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>While in the first it well directed is,</p>
<p class="slindent">And in the second moderates itself,</p>
<p class="slindent">It cannot be the cause of sinful pleasure;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But when to ill it turns, and, with more care</p>
<p class="slindent">Or lesser than it ought, runs after good,</p>
<p class="slindent">&rsquo;Gainst the Creator works his own creation.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Hence thou mayst comprehend that love must be</p>
<p class="slindent">The seed within yourselves of every virtue,</p>
<p class="slindent">And every act that merits punishment.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Now inasmuch as never from the welfare</p>
<p class="slindent">Of its own subject can love turn its sight,</p>
<p class="slindent">From their own hatred all things are secure;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And since we cannot think of any being</p>
<p class="slindent">Standing alone, nor from the First divided,</p>
<p class="slindent">Of hating Him is all desire cut off.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Hence if, discriminating, I judge well,</p>
<p class="slindent">The evil that one loves is of one&rsquo;s neighbour,</p>
<p class="slindent">And this is born in three modes in your clay.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>There are, who, by abasement of their neighbour,</p>
<p class="slindent">Hope to excel, and therefore only long</p>
<p class="slindent">That from his greatness he may be cast down;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>There are, who power, grace, honour, and renown</p>
<p class="slindent">Fear they may lose because another rises,</p>
<p class="slindent">Thence are so sad that the reverse they love;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And there are those whom injury seems to chafe,</p>
<p class="slindent">So that it makes them greedy for revenge,</p>
<p class="slindent">And such must needs shape out another&rsquo;s harm.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>This threefold love is wept for down below;</p>
<p class="slindent">Now of the other will I have thee hear,</p>
<p class="slindent">That runneth after good with measure faulty.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Each one confusedly a good conceives</p>
<p class="slindent">Wherein the mind may rest, and longeth for it;</p>
<p class="slindent">Therefore to overtake it each one strives.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>If languid love to look on this attract you,</p>
<p class="slindent">Or in attaining unto it, this cornice,</p>
<p class="slindent">After just penitence, torments you for it.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>There&rsquo;s other good that does not make man happy;</p>
<p class="slindent">&rsquo;Tis not felicity, &rsquo;tis not the good</p>
<p class="slindent">Essence, of every good the fruit and root.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The love that yields itself too much to this</p>
<p class="slindent">Above us is lamented in three circles;</p>
<p class="slindent">But how tripartite it may be described,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I say not, that thou seek it for thyself.&rdquo;</p></div>`,

`<p class="cantohead">Purgatorio: Canto XVIII</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>An end had put unto his reasoning</p>
<p class="slindent">The lofty Teacher, and attent was looking</p>
<p class="slindent">Into my face, if I appeared content;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And I, whom a new thirst still goaded on,</p>
<p class="slindent">Without was mute, and said within: &ldquo;Perchance</p>
<p class="slindent">The too much questioning I make annoys him.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But that true Father, who had comprehended</p>
<p class="slindent">The timid wish, that opened not itself,</p>
<p class="slindent">By speaking gave me hardihood to speak.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Whence I: &ldquo;My sight is, Master, vivified</p>
<p class="slindent">So in thy light, that clearly I discern</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>Therefore I thee entreat, sweet Father dear,</p>

<p class="slindent">The error of the blind, who would be leaders.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The soul, which is created apt to love,</p>
<p class="slindent">Is mobile unto everything that pleases,</p>
<p class="slindent">Soon as by pleasure she is waked to action.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Your apprehension from some real thing</p>
<p class="slindent">An image draws, and in yourselves displays it</p>
<p class="slindent">So that it makes the soul turn unto it.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And if, when turned, towards it she incline,</p>
<p class="slindent">Love is that inclination; it is nature,</p>
<p class="slindent">Which is by pleasure bound in you anew</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Now may apparent be to thee how hidden</p>
<p class="slindent">The truth is from those people, who aver</p>
<p class="slindent">All love is in itself a laudable thing;</p></div>

<p class="slindent">Aye to be good; but yet not each impression</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Thy words, and my sequacious intellect,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">I answered him, &ldquo;have love revealed to me;</p>

<p class="slindent">From matter is, and with it is united,</p>
<p class="slindent">Specific power has in itself collected,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Which without act is not perceptible,</p>
<p class="slindent">Nor shows itself except by its effect,</p>
<p class="slindent">As life does in a plant by the green leaves.</p></div>

<p class="slindent">And the affection for the first allurements,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Which are in you as instinct in the bee</p>
<p class="slindent">To make its honey; and this first desire</p>
<p class="slindent">Merit of praise or blame containeth not.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Now, that to this all others may be gathered,</p>
<p class="slindent">Innate within you is the power that counsels,</p>

<p class="slindent">Sees it &rsquo;twixt Sardes and Corsicans go down;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And that patrician shade, for whom is named</p>
<p class="slindent">Pietola more than any Mantuan town,</p>
<p class="slindent">Had laid aside the burden of my lading;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Whence I, who reason manifest and plain</p>
<p class="slindent">In answer to my questions had received,</p>
<p class="slindent">Stood like a man in drowsy reverie.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But taken from me was this drowsiness</p>
<p class="slindent">Suddenly by a people, that behind</p>
<p class="slindent">Our backs already had come round to us.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And as, of old, Ismenus and Asopus</p>
<p class="slindent">Beside them saw at night the rush and throng,</p>
<p class="slindent">If but the Thebans were in need of Bacchus,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So they along that circle curve their step,</p>
<p class="slindent">From what I saw of those approaching us,</p>
<p class="slindent">Who by good-will and righteous love are ridden.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Full soon they were upon us, because running</p>
<p class="slindent">Moved onward all that mighty multitude,</p>
<p class="slindent">And two in the advance cried out, lamenting,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Mary in haste unto the mountain ran,</p>
<p class="slindent">And Caesar, that he might subdue Ilerda,</p>
<p class="slindent">Thrust at Marseilles, and then ran into Spain.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Quick! quick! so that the time may not be lost</p>
<p class="slindent">By little love!&rdquo; forthwith the others cried,</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;For ardour in well-doing freshens grace!&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;O folk, in whom an eager fervour now</p>
<p class="slindent">Supplies perhaps delay and negligence,</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>This one who lives, and truly I lie not,</p>
<p class="slindent">Would fain go up, if but the sun relight us;</p>
<p class="slindent">So tell us where the passage nearest is.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>These were the words of him who was my Guide;</p>
<p class="slindent">And some one of those spirits said: &ldquo;Come on</p>
<p class="slindent">Behind us, and the opening shalt thou find;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So full of longing are we to move onward,</p>
<p class="slindent">That stay we cannot; therefore pardon us,</p>
<p class="slindent">If thou for churlishness our justice take.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I was San Zeno&rsquo;s Abbot at Verona,</p>
<p class="slindent">Under the empire of good Barbarossa,</p>
<p class="slindent">Of whom still sorrowing Milan holds discourse;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And he has one foot in the grave already,</p>
<p class="slindent">Who shall erelong lament that monastery,</p>
<p class="slindent">And sorry be of having there had power,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Because his son, in his whole body sick,</p>
<p class="slindent">And worse in mind, and who was evil-born,</p>
<p class="slindent">He put into the place of its true pastor.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>If more he said, or silent was, I know not,</p>
<p class="slindent">He had already passed so far beyond us;</p>
<p class="slindent">But this I heard, and to retain it pleased me.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And he who was in every need my succour</p>
<p class="slindent">Said: &ldquo;Turn thee hitherward; see two of them</p>
<p class="slindent">Come fastening upon slothfulness their teeth.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>In rear of all they shouted: &ldquo;Sooner were</p>
<p class="slindent">The people dead to whom the sea was opened,</p>
<p class="slindent">Than their inheritors the Jordan saw;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And those who the fatigue did not endure</p>
<p class="slindent">Unto the issue, with Anchises&rsquo; son,</p>
<p class="slindent">Themselves to life withouten glory offered.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then when from us so separated were</p>
<p class="slindent">Those shades, that they no longer could be seen,</p>
<p class="slindent">Within me a new thought did entrance find,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Whence others many and diverse were born;</p>
<p class="slindent">And so I lapsed from one into another,</p>
<p class="slindent">That in a reverie mine eyes I closed,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And meditation into dream transmuted.</p></div>`,

`<p class="cantohead">Purgatorio: Canto XIX</p>

<p class="slindent">No more can warm the coldness of the moon,</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>There came to me in dreams a stammering woman,</p>
<p class="slindent">Squint in her eyes, and in her feet distorted,</p>
<p class="slindent">With hands dissevered and of sallow hue.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I looked at her; and as the sun restores</p>
<p class="slindent">The frigid members which the night benumbs,</p>
<p class="slindent">Even thus my gaze did render voluble</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Her tongue, and made her all erect thereafter</p>
<p class="slindent">In little while, and the lost countenance</p>
<p class="slindent">As love desires it so in her did colour.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>When in this wise she had her speech unloosed,</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; she sang, &ldquo;I am the Siren sweet</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>I drew Ulysses from his wandering way</p>
<p class="slindent">Unto my song, and he who dwells with me</p>
<p class="slindent">Seldom departs so wholly I content him.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Her mouth was not yet closed again, before</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Virgilius, O Virgilius! who is this?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Sternly she said; and he was drawing near</p>
<p class="slindent">With eyes still fixed upon that modest one.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>She seized the other and in front laid open,</p>
<p class="slindent">Rending her garments, and her belly showed me;</p>
<p class="slindent">This waked me with the stench that issued from it.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I turned mine eyes, and good Virgilius said:</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;At least thrice have I called thee; rise and come;</p>
<p class="slindent">Find we the opening by which thou mayst enter.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I rose; and full already of high day</p>

<p class="slindent">Spoken in a manner gentle and benign,</p>
<p class="slindent">Such as we hear not in this mortal region.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>With open wings, which of a swan appeared,</p>

<p class="slindent">So that I cannot from the thought withdraw me.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Didst thou behold,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that old enchantress,</p>

<p class="slindent">Through the desire of food that draws him thither,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Such I became, and such, as far as cleaves</p>
<p class="slindent">The rock to give a way to him who mounts,</p>
<p class="slindent">Went on to where the circling doth begin.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>On the fifth circle when I had come forth,</p>
<p class="slindent">People I saw upon it who were weeping,</p>
<p class="slindent">Stretched prone upon the ground, all downward turned.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Adhaesit pavimento anima mea,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">I heard them say with sighings so profound,</p>

<p class="slindent">To what the sight of my desire implored.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>When of myself I could dispose at will,</p>
<p class="slindent">Above that creature did I draw myself,</p>
<p class="slindent">Whose words before had caused me to take note,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Saying: &ldquo;O Spirit, in whom weeping ripens</p>
<p class="slindent">That without which to God we cannot turn,</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>So I went onward timorous and thoughtful.</p></div>`,

`<p class="cantohead">Purgatorio: Canto XXI</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>The natural thirst, that ne&rsquo;et is satisfied</p>
<p class="slindent">Excepting with the water for whose grace</p>
<p class="slindent">The woman of Samaria besought,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Put me in travail, and haste goaded me</p>
<p class="slindent">Along the encumbered path behind my Leader</p>
<p class="slindent">And I was pitying that righteous vengeance;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And lo! in the same manner as Luke writeth</p>
<p class="slindent">That Christ appeared to two upon the way</p>
<p class="slindent">From the sepulchral cave already risen,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>A shade appeared to us, and came behind us,</p>
<p class="slindent">Down gazing on the prostrate multitude,</p>
<p class="slindent">Nor were we ware of it, until it spake,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Saying, &ldquo;My brothers, may God give you peace!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">We turned us suddenly, and Virgilius rendered</p>
<p class="slindent">To him the countersign thereto conforming.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thereon began he: &ldquo;In the blessed council,</p>
<p class="slindent">Thee may the court veracious place in peace,</p>
<p class="slindent">That me doth banish in eternal exile!&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;How,&rdquo; said he, and the while we went with speed,</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;If ye are shades whom God deigns not on high,</p>
<p class="slindent">Who up his stairs so far has guided you?&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And said my Teacher: &ldquo;If thou note the marks</p>
<p class="slindent">Which this one bears, and which the Angel traces</p>
<p class="slindent">Well shalt thou see he with the good must reign.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But because she who spinneth day and night</p>
<p class="slindent">For him had not yet drawn the distaff off,</p>
<p class="slindent">Which Clotho lays for each one and compacts,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>His soul, which is thy sister and my own,</p>
<p class="slindent">In coming upwards could not come alone,</p>
<p class="slindent">By reason that it sees not in our fashion.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Whence I was drawn from out the ample throat</p>
<p class="slindent">Of Hell to be his guide, and I shall guide him</p>
<p class="slindent">As far on as my school has power to lead.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But tell us, if thou knowest, why such a shudder</p>
<p class="slindent">Erewhile the mountain gave, and why together</p>
<p class="slindent">All seemed to cry, as far as its moist feet?&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>In asking he so hit the very eye</p>
<p class="slindent">Of my desire, that merely with the hope</p>
<p class="slindent">My thirst became the less unsatisfied.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Naught is there,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;that without order</p>
<p class="slindent">May the religion of the mountain feel,</p>
<p class="slindent">Nor aught that may be foreign to its custom.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Free is it here from every permutation;</p>
<p class="slindent">What from itself heaven in itself receiveth</p>
<p class="slindent">Can be of this the cause, and naught beside;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Because that neither rain, nor hail, nor snow,</p>
<p class="slindent">Nor dew, nor hoar-frost any higher falls</p>
<p class="slindent">Than the short, little stairway of three steps.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Dense clouds do not appear, nor rarefied,</p>
<p class="slindent">Nor coruscation, nor the daughter of Thaumas,</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>No arid vapour any farther rises</p>
<p class="slindent">Than to the top of the three steps I spake of,</p>
<p class="slindent">Whereon the Vicar of Peter has his feet.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Lower down perchance it trembles less or more,</p>
<p class="slindent">But, for the wind that in the earth is hidden</p>
<p class="slindent">I know not how, up here it never trembled.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>It trembles here, whenever any soul</p>
<p class="slindent">Feels itself pure, so that it soars, or moves</p>
<p class="slindent">To mount aloft, and such a cry attends it.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Of purity the will alone gives proof,</p>
<p class="slindent">Which, being wholly free to change its convent,</p>
<p class="slindent">Takes by surprise the soul, and helps it fly.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>First it wills well; but the desire permits not,</p>
<p class="slindent">Which divine justice with the self-same will</p>
<p class="slindent">There was to sin, upon the torment sets.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And I, who have been lying in this pain</p>
<p class="slindent">Five hundred years and more, but just now felt</p>
<p class="slindent">A free volition for a better seat.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Therefore thou heardst the earthquake, and the pious</p>
<p class="slindent">Spirits along the mountain rendering praise</p>
<p class="slindent">Unto the Lord, that soon he speed them upwards.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So said he to him; and since we enjoy</p>
<p class="slindent">As much in drinking as the thirst is great,</p>
<p class="slindent">I could not say how much it did me good.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And the wise Leader: &ldquo;Now I see the net</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>Now who thou wast be pleased that I may know;</p>

<p class="slindent">Virgilius lived, I would accept one sun</p>
<p class="slindent">More than I must ere issuing from my ban.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>These words towards me made Virgilius turn</p>
<p class="slindent">With looks that in their silence said, &ldquo;Be silent!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">But yet the power that wills cannot do all things;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>For tears and laughter are such pursuivants</p>
<p class="slindent">Unto the passion from which each springs forth,</p>
<p class="slindent">In the most truthful least the will they follow.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I only smiled, as one who gives the wink;</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>Now am I caught on this side and on that;</p>
<p class="slindent">One keeps me silent, one to speak conjures me,</p>
<p class="slindent">Wherefore I sigh, and I am understood.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Speak,&rdquo; said my Master, &ldquo;and be not afraid</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>Already he was stooping to embrace</p>
<p class="slindent">My Teacher&rsquo;s feet; but he said to him: &ldquo;Brother,</p>
<p class="slindent">Do not; for shade thou art, and shade beholdest.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And he uprising: &ldquo;Now canst thou the sum</p>
<p class="slindent">Of love which warms me to thee comprehend,</p>

`<p class="cantohead">Purgatorio: Canto XXII</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>Already was the Angel left behind us,</p>
<p class="slindent">The Angel who to the sixth round had turned us,</p>
<p class="slindent">Having erased one mark from off my face;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And those who have in justice their desire</p>
<p class="slindent">Had said to us, &ldquo;Beati,&rdquo; in their voices,</p>
<p class="slindent">With &ldquo;sitio,&rdquo; and without more ended it.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And I, more light than through the other passes,</p>

<p class="slindent">Among us into the infernal Limbo,</p>

<p class="slindent">As ever bound one to an unseen person,</p>
<p class="slindent">So that these stairs will now seem short to me.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But tell me, and forgive me as a friend,</p>
<p class="slindent">If too great confidence let loose the rein,</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>How was it possible within thy breast</p>
<p class="slindent">For avarice to find place, &rsquo;mid so much wisdom</p>
<p class="slindent">As thou wast filled with by thy diligence?&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>These words excited Statius at first</p>
<p class="slindent">Somewhat to laughter; afterward he answered:</p>

<p class="slindent">Too far from me; and this extravagance</p>
<p class="slindent">Thousands of lunar periods have punished.</p></div>

<p class="slindent">Of gold, the appetite of mortal men?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Revolving I should feel the dismal joustings.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then I perceived the hands could spread too wide</p>
<p class="slindent">Their wings in spending, and repented me</p>
<p class="slindent">As well of that as of my other sins;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>How many with shorn hair shall rise again</p>
<p class="slindent">Because of ignorance, which from this sin</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>Therefore if I have been among that folk</p>
<p class="slindent">Which mourns its avarice, to purify me,</p>
<p class="slindent">For its opposite has this befallen me.&rdquo;</p></div>

<p class="slindent">Who bears his light behind, which helps him not,</p>
<p class="slindent">But wary makes the persons after him,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>When thou didst say: &lsquo;The age renews itself,</p>
<p class="slindent">Justice returns, and man&rsquo;s primeval time,</p>
<p class="slindent">And a new progeny descends from heaven.&rsquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Through thee I Poet was, through thee a Christian;</p>
<p class="slindent">But that thou better see what I design,</p>
<p class="slindent">To colour it will I extend my hand.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Already was the world in every part</p>
<p class="slindent">Pregnant with the true creed, disseminated</p>
<p class="slindent">By messengers of the eternal kingdom;</p></div>

<p class="slindent">With the new preachers was in unison;</p>
<p class="slindent">Whence I to visit them the custom took.</p></div>

<p class="slindent">That, when Domitian persecuted them,</p>
<p class="slindent">Not without tears of mine were their laments;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And all the while that I on earth remained,</p>
<p class="slindent">Them I befriended, and their upright customs</p>
<p class="slindent">Made me disparage all the other sects.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And ere I led the Greeks unto the rivers</p>
<p class="slindent">Of Thebes, in poetry, I was baptized,</p>
<p class="slindent">But out of fear was covertly a Christian,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>For a long time professing paganism;</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thou, therefore, who hast raised the covering</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>Tell me, in what place is our friend Terentius,</p>
<p class="slindent">Caecilius, Plautus, Varro, if thou knowest;</p>
<p class="slindent">Tell me if they are damned, and in what alley.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;These, Persius and myself, and others many,&rdquo;</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>In the first circle of the prison blind;</p>
<p class="slindent">Ofttimes we of the mountain hold discourse</p>
<p class="slindent">Which has our nurses ever with itself.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Euripides is with us, Antiphon,</p>

<p class="slindent">Antigone, Deiphile and Argia,</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>There she is seen who pointed out Langia;</p>
<p class="slindent">There is Tiresias&rsquo; daughter, and there Thetis,</p>
<p class="slindent">And there Deidamia with her sisters.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Silent already were the poets both,</p>
<p class="slindent">Attent once more in looking round about,</p>
<p class="slindent">From the ascent and from the walls released;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And four handmaidens of the day already</p>
<p class="slindent">Were left behind, and at the pole the fifth</p>
<p class="slindent">Was pointing upward still its burning horn,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>What time my Guide: &ldquo;I think that tow&rsquo;rds the edge</p>
<p class="slindent">Our dexter shoulders it behoves us turn,</p>

<p class="slindent">And we resumed our way with less suspicion</p>
<p class="slindent">For the assenting of that worthy soul</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>They in advance went on, and I alone</p>
<p class="slindent">Behind them, and I listened to their speech,</p>
<p class="slindent">Which gave me lessons in the art of song.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But soon their sweet discourses interrupted</p>
<p class="slindent">A tree which midway in the road we found,</p>
<p class="slindent">With apples sweet and grateful to the smell.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And even as a fir-tree tapers upward</p>
<p class="slindent">From bough to bough, so downwardly did that;</p>
<p class="slindent">I think in order that no one might climb it.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>On that side where our pathway was enclosed</p>
<p class="slindent">Fell from the lofty rock a limpid water,</p>
<p class="slindent">And spread itself abroad upon the leaves.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The Poets twain unto the tree drew near,</p>
<p class="slindent">And from among the foliage a voice</p>
<p class="slindent">Cried: &ldquo;Of this food ye shall have scarcity.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then said: &ldquo;More thoughtful Mary was of making</p>
<p class="slindent">The marriage feast complete and honourable,</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>And for their drink the ancient Roman women</p>
<p class="slindent">With water were content; and Daniel</p>
<p class="slindent">Disparaged food, and understanding won.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The primal age was beautiful as gold;</p>
<p class="slindent">Acorns it made with hunger savorous,</p>
<p class="slindent">And nectar every rivulet with thirst.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Honey and locusts were the aliments</p>
<p class="slindent">That fed the Baptist in the wilderness;</p>

`<p class="cantohead">Purgatorio: Canto XXIII</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>The while among the verdant leaves mine eyes</p>

<p class="slindent">Who wastes his life pursuing little birds,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>My more than Father said unto me: &ldquo;Son,</p>
<p class="slindent">Come now; because the time that is ordained us</p>
<p class="slindent">More usefully should be apportioned out.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I turned my face and no less soon my steps</p>
<p class="slindent">Unto the Sages, who were speaking so</p>
<p class="slindent">They made the going of no cost to me;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And lo! were heard a song and a lament,</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Labia mea, Domine,&rdquo; in fashion</p>
<p class="slindent">Such that delight and dolence it brought forth.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;O my sweet Father, what is this I hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Began I; and he answered: &ldquo;Shades that go</p>
<p class="slindent">Perhaps the knot unloosing of their debt.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>In the same way that thoughtful pilgrims do,</p>
<p class="slindent">Who, unknown people on the road o&rsquo;ettaking,</p>
<p class="slindent">Turn themselves round to them, and do not stop,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Even thus, behind us with a swifter motion</p>
<p class="slindent">Coming and passing onward, gazed upon us</p>
<p class="slindent">A crowd of spirits silent and devout.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Each in his eyes was dark and cavernous,</p>
<p class="slindent">Pallid in face, and so emaciate</p>
<p class="slindent">That from the bones the skin did shape itself.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I do not think that so to merest rind</p>
<p class="slindent">Could Erisichthon have been withered up</p>
<p class="slindent">By famine, when most fear he had of it.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thinking within myself I said: &ldquo;Behold,</p>
<p class="slindent">This is the folk who lost Jerusalem,</p>
<p class="slindent">When Mary made a prey of her own son.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Their sockets were like rings without the gems;</p>
<p class="slindent">Whoever in the face of men reads &lsquo;omo&rsquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Might well in these have recognised the &lsquo;m.&rsquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Who would believe the odour of an apple,</p>
<p class="slindent">Begetting longing, could consume them so,</p>
<p class="slindent">And that of water, without knowing how?</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I still was wondering what so famished them,</p>
<p class="slindent">For the occasion not yet manifest</p>
<p class="slindent">Of their emaciation and sad squalor;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And lo! from out the hollow of his head</p>
<p class="slindent">His eyes a shade turned on me, and looked keenly;</p>
<p class="slindent">Then cried aloud: &ldquo;What grace to me is this?&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Never should I have known him by his look;</p>
<p class="slindent">But in his voice was evident to me</p>
<p class="slindent">That which his aspect had suppressed within it.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>This spark within me wholly re-enkindled</p>
<p class="slindent">My recognition of his altered face,</p>
<p class="slindent">And I recalled the features of Forese.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Ah, do not look at this dry leprosy,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Entreated he, &ldquo;which doth my skin discolour,</p>
<p class="slindent">Nor at default of flesh that I may have;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But tell me truth of thee, and who are those</p>
<p class="slindent">Two souls, that yonder make for thee an escort;</p>
<p class="slindent">Do not delay in speaking unto me.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;That face of thine, which dead I once bewept,</p>
<p class="slindent">Gives me for weeping now no lesser grief,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">I answered him, &ldquo;beholding it so changed!</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But tell me, for God&rsquo;s sake, what thus denudes you?</p>
<p class="slindent">Make me not speak while I am marvelling,</p>

<p class="slindent">The scent that issues from the apple-tree,</p>
<p class="slindent">And from the spray that sprinkles o&rsquo;et the verdure;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And not a single time alone, this ground</p>
<p class="slindent">Encompassing, is refreshed our pain,—</p>
<p class="slindent">I say our pain, and ought to say our solace,—</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>For the same wish doth lead us to the tree</p>
<p class="slindent">Which led the Christ rejoicing to say &lsquo;Eli,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">When with his veins he liberated us.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And I to him: &ldquo;Forese, from that day</p>
<p class="slindent">When for a better life thou changedst worlds,</p>
<p class="slindent">Up to this time five years have not rolled round.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>If sooner were the power exhausted in thee</p>
<p class="slindent">Of sinning more, than thee the hour surprised</p>
<p class="slindent">Of that good sorrow which to God reweds us,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>How hast thou come up hitherward already?</p>
<p class="slindent">I thought to find thee down there underneath,</p>
<p class="slindent">Where time for time doth restitution make.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And he to me: &ldquo;Thus speedily has led me</p>
<p class="slindent">To drink of the sweet wormwood of these torments,</p>
<p class="slindent">My Nella with her overflowing tears;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>She with her prayers devout and with her sighs</p>
<p class="slindent">Has drawn me from the coast where one where one awaits,</p>
<p class="slindent">And from the other circles set me free.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So much more dear and pleasing is to God</p>
<p class="slindent">My little widow, whom so much I loved,</p>

<p class="slindent">By far more modest in its women is</p>
<p class="slindent">Than the Barbagia I have left her in.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>O brother sweet, what wilt thou have me say?</p>
<p class="slindent">A future time is in my sight already,</p>
<p class="slindent">To which this hour will not be very old,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>When from the pulpit shall be interdicted</p>
<p class="slindent">To the unblushing womankind of Florence</p>
<p class="slindent">To go about displaying breast and paps.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>What savages were e&rsquo;et, what Saracens,</p>
<p class="slindent">Who stood in need, to make them covered go,</p>
<p class="slindent">Of spiritual or other discipline?</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But if the shameless women were assured</p>
<p class="slindent">Of what swift Heaven prepares for them, already</p>
<p class="slindent">Wide open would they have their mouths to howl;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>For if my foresight here deceive me not,</p>
<p class="slindent">They shall be sad ere he has bearded cheeks</p>
<p class="slindent">Who now is hushed to sleep with lullaby.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>O brother, now no longer hide thee from me;</p>
<p class="slindent">See that not only I, but all these people</p>
<p class="slindent">Are gazing there, where thou dost veil the sun.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Whence I to him: &ldquo;If thou bring back to mind</p>
<p class="slindent">What thou with me hast been and I with thee,</p>
<p class="slindent">The present memory will be grievous still.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Out of that life he turned me back who goes</p>
<p class="slindent">In front of me, two days agone when round</p>
<p class="slindent">The sister of him yonder showed herself,&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And to the sun I pointed.  &ldquo;Through the deep</p>
<p class="slindent">Night of the truly dead has this one led me,</p>
<p class="slindent">With this true flesh, that follows after him.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thence his encouragements have led me up,</p>
<p class="slindent">Ascending and still circling round the mount</p>
<p class="slindent">That you doth straighten, whom the world made crooked.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>He says that he will bear me company,</p>
<p class="slindent">Till I shall be where Beatrice will be;</p>
<p class="slindent">There it behoves me to remain without him.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>This is Virgilius, who thus says to me,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">And him I pointed at; &ldquo;the other is</p>
<p class="slindent">That shade for whom just now shook every slope</p></div>

`<p class="cantohead">Purgatorio: Canto XXIV</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>Nor speech the going, nor the going that</p>
<p class="slindent">Slackened; but talking we went bravely on,</p>
<p class="slindent">Even as a vessel urged by a good wind.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And shadows, that appeared things doubly dead,</p>
<p class="slindent">From out the sepulchres of their eyes betrayed</p>
<p class="slindent">Wonder at me, aware that I was living.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And I, continuing my colloquy,</p>
<p class="slindent">Said: &ldquo;Peradventure he goes up more slowly</p>
<p class="slindent">Than he would do, for other people&rsquo;s sake.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But tell me, if thou knowest, where is Piccarda;</p>
<p class="slindent">Tell me if any one of note I see</p>
<p class="slindent">Among this folk that gazes at me so.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;My sister, who, &rsquo;twixt beautiful and good,</p>
<p class="slindent">I know not which was more, triumphs rejoicing</p>
<p class="slindent">Already in her crown on high Olympus.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So said he first, and then: &ldquo;&rsquo;Tis not forbidden</p>
<p class="slindent">To name each other here, so milked away</p>
<p class="slindent">Is our resemblance by our dieting.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>This,&rdquo; pointing with his finger, &ldquo;is Buonagiunta,</p>
<p class="slindent">Buonagiunta, of Lucca; and that face</p>
<p class="slindent">Beyond him there, more peaked than the others,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Has held the holy Church within his arms;</p>
<p class="slindent">From Tours was he, and purges by his fasting</p>
<p class="slindent">Bolsena&rsquo;s eels and the Vernaccia wine.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>He named me many others one by one;</p>
<p class="slindent">And all contented seemed at being named,</p>
<p class="slindent">So that for this I saw not one dark look.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I saw for hunger bite the empty air</p>
<p class="slindent">Ubaldin dalla Pila, and Boniface,</p>
<p class="slindent">Who with his crook had pastured many people.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I saw Messer Marchese, who had leisure</p>
<p class="slindent">Once at Forli for drinking with less dryness,</p>
<p class="slindent">And he was one who ne&rsquo;et felt satisfied.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But as he does who scans, and then doth prize</p>
<p class="slindent">One more than others, did I him of Lucca,</p>
<p class="slindent">Who seemed to take most cognizance of me.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>He murmured, and I know not what Gentucca</p>
<p class="slindent">From that place heard I, where he felt the wound</p>
<p class="slindent">Of justice, that doth macerate them so.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;O soul,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that seemest so desirous</p>
<p class="slindent">To speak with me, do so that I may hear thee,</p>
<p class="slindent">And with thy speech appease thyself and me.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;A maid is born, and wears not yet the veil,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Began he, &ldquo;who to thee shall pleasant make</p>
<p class="slindent">My city, howsoever men may blame it.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thou shalt go on thy way with this prevision;</p>
<p class="slindent">If by my murmuring thou hast been deceived,</p>
<p class="slindent">True things hereafter will declare it to thee.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But say if him I here behold, who forth</p>
<p class="slindent">Evoked the new-invented rhymes, beginning,</p>
<p class="slindent">&lsquo;Ladies, that have intelligence of love?&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And I to him: &ldquo;One am I, who, whenever</p>
<p class="slindent">Love doth inspire me, note, and in that measure</p>
<p class="slindent">Which he within me dictates, singing go.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;O brother, now I see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the knot</p>
<p class="slindent">Which me, the Notary, and Guittone held</p>
<p class="slindent">Short of the sweet new style that now I hear.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I do perceive full clearly how your pens</p>
<p class="slindent">Go closely following after him who dictates,</p>
<p class="slindent">Which with our own forsooth came not to pass;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And he who sets himself to go beyond,</p>
<p class="slindent">No difference sees from one style to another;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">And as if satisfied, he held his peace.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Even as the birds, that winter tow&rsquo;rds the Nile,</p>
<p class="slindent">Sometimes into a phalanx form themselves,</p>
<p class="slindent">Then fly in greater haste, and go in file;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>In such wise all the people who were there,</p>
<p class="slindent">Turning their faces, hurried on their steps,</p>
<p class="slindent">Both by their leanness and their wishes light.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And as a man, who weary is with trotting,</p>
<p class="slindent">Lets his companions onward go, and walks,</p>
<p class="slindent">Until he vents the panting of his chest;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So did Forese let the holy flock</p>
<p class="slindent">Pass by, and came with me behind it, saying,</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;When will it be that I again shall see thee?&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;How long,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;I may live, I know not;</p>
<p class="slindent">Yet my return will not so speedy be,</p>
<p class="slindent">But I shall sooner in desire arrive;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Because the place where I was set to live</p>
<p class="slindent">From day to day of good is more depleted,</p>
<p class="slindent">And unto dismal ruin seems ordained.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Now go,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for him most guilty of it</p>
<p class="slindent">At a beast&rsquo;s tail behold I dragged along</p>
<p class="slindent">Towards the valley where is no repentance.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Faster at every step the beast is going,</p>
<p class="slindent">Increasing evermore until it smites him,</p>
<p class="slindent">And leaves the body vilely mutilated.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Not long those wheels shall turn,&rdquo; and he uplifted</p>
<p class="slindent">His eyes to heaven, &ldquo;ere shall be clear to thee</p>
<p class="slindent">That which my speech no farther can declare.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Now stay behind; because the time so precious</p>
<p class="slindent">Is in this kingdom, that I lose too much</p>
<p class="slindent">By coming onward thus abreast with thee.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>As sometimes issues forth upon a gallop</p>
<p class="slindent">A cavalier from out a troop that ride,</p>
<p class="slindent">And seeks the honour of the first encounter,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So he with greater strides departed from us;</p>
<p class="slindent">And on the road remained I with those two,</p>
<p class="slindent">Who were such mighty marshals of the world.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And when before us he had gone so far</p>
<p class="slindent">Mine eyes became to him such pursuivants</p>
<p class="slindent">As was my understanding to his words,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Appeared to me with laden and living boughs</p>
<p class="slindent">Another apple-tree, and not far distant,</p>
<p class="slindent">From having but just then turned thitherward.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>People I saw beneath it lift their hands,</p>
<p class="slindent">And cry I know not what towards the leaves,</p>
<p class="slindent">Like little children eager and deluded,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Who pray, and he they pray to doth not answer,</p>
<p class="slindent">But, to make very keen their appetite,</p>
<p class="slindent">Holds their desire aloft, and hides it not.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then they departed as if undeceived;</p>
<p class="slindent">And now we came unto the mighty tree</p>
<p class="slindent">Which prayers and tears so manifold refuses.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Pass farther onward without drawing near;</p>
<p class="slindent">The tree of which Eve ate is higher up,</p>
<p class="slindent">And out of that one has this tree been raised.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thus said I know not who among the branches;</p>
<p class="slindent">Whereat Virgilius, Statius, and myself</p>
<p class="slindent">Went crowding forward on the side that rises.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Be mindful,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;of the accursed ones</p>
<p class="slindent">Formed of the cloud-rack, who inebriate</p>
<p class="slindent">Combated Theseus with their double breasts;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And of the Jews who showed them soft in drinking,</p>
<p class="slindent">Whence Gideon would not have them for companions</p>
<p class="slindent">When he tow&rsquo;rds Midian the hills descended.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thus, closely pressed to one of the two borders,</p>
<p class="slindent">On passed we, hearing sins of gluttony,</p>
<p class="slindent">Followed forsooth by miserable gains;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then set at large upon the lonely road,</p>
<p class="slindent">A thousand steps and more we onward went,</p>
<p class="slindent">In contemplation, each without a word.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;What go ye thinking thus, ye three alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Said suddenly a voice, whereat I started</p>
<p class="slindent">As terrified and timid beasts are wont.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I raised my head to see who this might be,</p>
<p class="slindent">And never in a furnace was there seen</p>
<p class="slindent">Metals or glass so lucent and so red</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>As one I saw who said: &ldquo;If it may please you</p>
<p class="slindent">To mount aloft, here it behoves you turn;</p>
<p class="slindent">This way goes he who goeth after peace.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>His aspect had bereft me of my sight,</p>
<p class="slindent">So that I turned me back unto my Teachers,</p>
<p class="slindent">Like one who goeth as his hearing guides him.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And as, the harbinger of early dawn,</p>
<p class="slindent">The air of May doth move and breathe out fragrance,</p>
<p class="slindent">Impregnate all with herbage and with flowers,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So did I feel a breeze strike in the midst</p>
<p class="slindent">My front, and felt the moving of the plumes</p>
<p class="slindent">That breathed around an odour of ambrosia;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And heard it said: &ldquo;Blessed are they whom grace</p>
<p class="slindent">So much illumines, that the love of taste</p>
<p class="slindent">Excites not in their breasts too great desire,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Hungering at all times so far as is just.&rdquo;</p></div>`,

`<p class="cantohead">Purgatorio: Canto XXV</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>Now was it the ascent no hindrance brooked,</p>
<p class="slindent">Because the sun had his meridian circle</p>
<p class="slindent">To Taurus left, and night to Scorpio;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Wherefore as doth a man who tarries not,</p>
<p class="slindent">But goes his way, whate&rsquo;et to him appear,</p>
<p class="slindent">If of necessity the sting transfix him,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>In this wise did we enter through the gap,</p>
<p class="slindent">Taking the stairway, one before the other,</p>
<p class="slindent">Which by its narrowness divides the climbers.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And as the little stork that lifts its wing</p>
<p class="slindent">With a desire to fly, and does not venture</p>
<p class="slindent">To leave the nest, and lets it downward droop,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Even such was I, with the desire of asking</p>
<p class="slindent">Kindled and quenched, unto the motion coming</p>
<p class="slindent">He makes who doth address himself to speak.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Not for our pace, though rapid it might be,</p>
<p class="slindent">My father sweet forbore, but said: &ldquo;Let fly</p>
<p class="slindent">The bow of speech thou to the barb hast drawn.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>With confidence I opened then my mouth,</p>
<p class="slindent">And I began: &ldquo;How can one meagre grow</p>
<p class="slindent">There where the need of nutriment applies not?&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;If thou wouldst call to mind how Meleager</p>
<p class="slindent">Was wasted by the wasting of a brand,</p>
<p class="slindent">This would not,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;be to thee so sour;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And wouldst thou think how at each tremulous motion</p>
<p class="slindent">Trembles within a mirror your own image;</p>
<p class="slindent">That which seems hard would mellow seem to thee.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But that thou mayst content thee in thy wish</p>
<p class="slindent">Lo Statius here; and him I call and pray</p>
<p class="slindent">He now will be the healer of thy wounds.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;If I unfold to him the eternal vengeance,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Responded Statius, &ldquo;where thou present art,</p>
<p class="slindent">Be my excuse that I can naught deny thee.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then he began: &ldquo;Son, if these words of mine</p>
<p class="slindent">Thy mind doth contemplate and doth receive,</p>
<p class="slindent">They&rsquo;ll be thy light unto the How thou sayest.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The perfect blood, which never is drunk up</p>
<p class="slindent">Into the thirsty veins, and which remaineth</p>
<p class="slindent">Like food that from the table thou removest,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Takes in the heart for all the human members</p>
<p class="slindent">Virtue informative, as being that</p>
<p class="slindent">Which to be changed to them goes through the veins</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Again digest, descends it where &rsquo;tis better</p>
<p class="slindent">Silent to be than say; and then drops thence</p>
<p class="slindent">Upon another&rsquo;s blood in natural vase.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>There one together with the other mingles,</p>
<p class="slindent">One to be passive meant, the other active</p>
<p class="slindent">By reason of the perfect place it springs from;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And being conjoined, begins to operate,</p>
<p class="slindent">Coagulating first, then vivifying</p>
<p class="slindent">What for its matter it had made consistent.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The active virtue, being made a soul</p>
<p class="slindent">As of a plant, (in so far different,</p>
<p class="slindent">This on the way is, that arrived already,)</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then works so much, that now it moves and feels</p>
<p class="slindent">Like a sea-fungus, and then undertakes</p>
<p class="slindent">To organize the powers whose seed it is.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Now, Son, dilates and now distends itself</p>
<p class="slindent">The virtue from the generator&rsquo;s heart,</p>
<p class="slindent">Where nature is intent on all the members.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But how from animal it man becomes</p>
<p class="slindent">Thou dost not see as yet; this is a point</p>
<p class="slindent">Which made a wiser man than thou once err</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So far, that in his doctrine separate</p>
<p class="slindent">He made the soul from possible intellect,</p>
<p class="slindent">For he no organ saw by this assumed.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Open thy breast unto the truth that&rsquo;s coming,</p>
<p class="slindent">And know that, just as soon as in the foetus</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>The primal Motor turns to it well pleased</p>
<p class="slindent">At so great art of nature, and inspires</p>
<p class="slindent">A spirit new with virtue all replete,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Which what it finds there active doth attract</p>
<p class="slindent">Into its substance, and becomes one soul,</p>
<p class="slindent">Which lives, and feels, and on itself revolves.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And that thou less may wonder at my word,</p>
<p class="slindent">Behold the sun&rsquo;s heat, which becometh wine,</p>
<p class="slindent">Joined to the juice that from the vine distils.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Whenever Lachesis has no more thread,</p>
<p class="slindent">It separates from the flesh, and virtually</p>
<p class="slindent">Bears with itself the human and divine;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The other faculties are voiceless all;</p>
<p class="slindent">The memory, the intelligence, and the will</p>
<p class="slindent">In action far more vigorous than before.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Without a pause it falleth of itself</p>
<p class="slindent">In marvellous way on one shore or the other;</p>
<p class="slindent">There of its roads it first is cognizant.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Soon as the place there circumscribeth it,</p>
<p class="slindent">The virtue informative rays round about,</p>
<p class="slindent">As, and as much as, in the living members.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And even as the air, when full of rain,</p>
<p class="slindent">By alien rays that are therein reflected,</p>
<p class="slindent">With divers colours shows itself adorned,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So there the neighbouring air doth shape itself</p>
<p class="slindent">Into that form which doth impress upon it</p>
<p class="slindent">Virtually the soul that has stood still.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And then in manner of the little flame,</p>
<p class="slindent">Which followeth the fire where&rsquo;et it shifts,</p>
<p class="slindent">After the spirit followeth its new form.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Since afterwards it takes from this its semblance,</p>
<p class="slindent">It is called shade; and thence it organizes</p>
<p class="slindent">Thereafter every sense, even to the sight.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thence is it that we speak, and thence we laugh;</p>
<p class="slindent">Thence is it that we form the tears and sighs,</p>
<p class="slindent">That on the mountain thou mayhap hast heard.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>According as impress us our desires</p>
<p class="slindent">And other affections, so the shade is shaped,</p>
<p class="slindent">And this is cause of what thou wonderest at.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And now unto the last of all the circles</p>
<p class="slindent">Had we arrived, and to the right hand turned,</p>
<p class="slindent">And were attentive to another care.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>There the embankment shoots forth flames of fire,</p>
<p class="slindent">And upward doth the cornice breathe a blast</p>
<p class="slindent">That drives them back, and from itself sequesters.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Hence we must needs go on the open side,</p>
<p class="slindent">And one by one; and I did fear the fire</p>
<p class="slindent">On this side, and on that the falling down.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>My Leader said: &ldquo;Along this place one ought</p>
<p class="slindent">To keep upon the eyes a tightened rein,</p>
<p class="slindent">Seeing that one so easily might err.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Summae Deus clementiae,&rdquo; in the bosom</p>
<p class="slindent">Of the great burning chanted then I heard,</p>
<p class="slindent">Which made me no less eager to turn round;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And spirits saw I walking through the flame;</p>
<p class="slindent">Wherefore I looked, to my own steps and theirs</p>
<p class="slindent">Apportioning my sight from time to time.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>After the close which to that hymn is made,</p>
<p class="slindent">Aloud they shouted, &ldquo;Virum non cognosco;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Then recommenced the hymn with voices low.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>This also ended, cried they: &ldquo;To the wood</p>
<p class="slindent">Diana ran, and drove forth Helice</p>
<p class="slindent">Therefrom, who had of Venus felt the poison.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then to their song returned they; then the wives</p>
<p class="slindent">They shouted, and the husbands who were chaste.</p>
<p class="slindent">As virtue and the marriage vow imposes.</p></div>

`<p class="cantohead">Purgatorio: Canto XXVI</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>While on the brink thus one before the other</p>
<p class="slindent">We went upon our way, oft the good Master</p>
<p class="slindent">Said: &ldquo;Take thou heed! suffice it that I warn thee.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>On the right shoulder smote me now the sun,</p>
<p class="slindent">That, raying out, already the whole west</p>
<p class="slindent">Changed from its azure aspect into white.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And with my shadow did I make the flame</p>
<p class="slindent">Appear more red; and even to such a sign</p>
<p class="slindent">Shades saw I many, as they went, give heed.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>This was the cause that gave them a beginning</p>
<p class="slindent">To speak of me; and to themselves began they</p>
<p class="slindent">To say: &ldquo;That seems not a factitious body!&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then towards me, as far as they could come,</p>
<p class="slindent">Came certain of them, always with regard</p>
<p class="slindent">Not to step forth where they would not be burned.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;O thou who goest, not from being slower</p>
<p class="slindent">But reverent perhaps, behind the others,</p>
<p class="slindent">Answer me, who in thirst and fire am burning.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Nor to me only is thine answer needful;</p>
<p class="slindent">For all of these have greater thirst for it</p>
<p class="slindent">Than for cold water Ethiop or Indian.</p></div>

<p class="slindent">A wall unto the sun, as if thou hadst not</p>
<p class="slindent">Entered as yet into the net of death.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thus one of them addressed me, and I straight</p>

<p class="slindent">On other novelty that then appeared.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>For through the middle of the burning road</p>
<p class="slindent">There came a people face to face with these,</p>
<p class="slindent">Which held me in suspense with gazing at them.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>There see I hastening upon either side</p>
<p class="slindent">Each of the shades, and kissing one another</p>
<p class="slindent">Without a pause, content with brief salute.</p></div>

<p class="slindent">Might fly in part, and part towards the sands,</p>
<p class="slindent">These of the frost, those of the sun avoidant,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>One folk is going, and the other coming,</p>

<p class="slindent">But when they of their stupor were disburdened,</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>Therefore they separate, exclaiming, &lsquo;Sodom!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Themselves reproving, even as thou hast heard,</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>Our own transgression was hermaphrodite;</p>

<p class="slindent">There is not time to tell, nor could I do it.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thy wish to know me shall in sooth be granted;</p>
<p class="slindent">I&rsquo;m Guido Guinicelli, and now purge me,</p>
<p class="slindent">Having repented ere the hour extreme.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The same that in the sadness of Lycurgus</p>
<p class="slindent">Two sons became, their mother re-beholding,</p>
<p class="slindent">Such I became, but rise not to such height,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The moment I heard name himself the father</p>

<p class="slindent">Practised the sweet and gracious rhymes of love;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And without speech and hearing thoughtfully</p>
<p class="slindent">For a long time I went, beholding him,</p>
<p class="slindent">Nor for the fire did I approach him nearer.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>When I was fed with looking, utterly</p>
<p class="slindent">Myself I offered ready for his service,</p>
<p class="slindent">With affirmation that compels belief.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And he to me: &ldquo;Thou leavest footprints such</p>

<p class="slindent">Lethe cannot efface them, nor make dim.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But if thy words just now the truth have sworn,</p>
<p class="slindent">Tell me what is the cause why thou displayest</p>
<p class="slindent">In word and look that dear thou holdest me?&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And I to him: &ldquo;Those dulcet lays of yours</p>
<p class="slindent">Which, long as shall endure our modern fashion,</p>
<p class="slindent">Shall make for ever dear their very ink!&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;O brother,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;he whom I point out,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">And here he pointed at a spirit in front,</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Was of the mother tongue a better smith.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thus many ancients with Guittone did,</p>
<p class="slindent">From cry to cry still giving him applause,</p>
<p class="slindent">Until the truth has conquered with most persons.</p></div>

<p class="slindent">So far as needful to us of this world,</p>
<p class="slindent">Where power of sinning is no longer ours.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then, to give place perchance to one behind,</p>
<p class="slindent">Whom he had near, he vanished in the fire</p>
<p class="slindent">As fish in water going to the bottom.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I moved a little tow&rsquo;rds him pointed out,</p>
<p class="slindent">And said that to his name my own desire</p>
<p class="slindent">An honourable place was making ready.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>He of his own free will began to say:</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then hid him in the fire that purifies them.</p></div>`,

`<p class="cantohead">Purgatorio: Canto XXVII</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>Seeing me stand still motionless and stubborn,</p>
<p class="slindent">Somewhat disturbed he said: &ldquo;Now look thou, Son,</p>
<p class="slindent">&rsquo;Twixt Beatrice and thee there is this wall.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And my sweet Father, to encourage me,</p>
<p class="slindent">Discoursing still of Beatrice went on,</p>
<p class="slindent">Saying: &ldquo;Her eyes I seem to see already!&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>A voice, that on the other side was singing,</p>
<p class="slindent">Directed us, and we, attent alone</p>
<p class="slindent">On that, came forth where the ascent began.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Venite, benedicti Patris mei,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Sounded within a splendour, which was there</p>

<p class="slindent">Tarry ye not, but onward urge your steps,</p>
<p class="slindent">So long as yet the west becomes not dark.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Straight forward through the rock the path ascended</p>
<p class="slindent">In such a way that I cut off the rays</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>And ere in all its parts immeasurable</p>
<p class="slindent">The horizon of one aspect had become,</p>
<p class="slindent">And Night her boundless dispensation held,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Each of us of a stair had made his bed;</p>
<p class="slindent">Because the nature of the mount took from us</p>
<p class="slindent">The power of climbing, more than the delight.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Even as in ruminating passive grow</p>
<p class="slindent">The goats, who have been swift and venturesome</p>
<p class="slindent">Upon the mountain-tops ere they were fed,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And as the shepherd, lodging out of doors,</p>
<p class="slindent">Passes the night beside his quiet flock,</p>
<p class="slindent">Watching that no wild beast may scatter it,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Such at that hour were we, all three of us,</p>

<p class="slindent">More luminous and larger than their wont.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thus ruminating, and beholding these,</p>
<p class="slindent">Sleep seized upon me,—sleep, that oftentimes</p>
<p class="slindent">Before a deed is done has tidings of it.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>It was the hour, I think, when from the East</p>
<p class="slindent">First on the mountain Citherea beamed,</p>
<p class="slindent">Who with the fire of love seems always burning;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Youthful and beautiful in dreams methought</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>And my entreaties made to be content,</p>
<p class="slindent">So near approaching, that the dulcet sound</p>
<p class="slindent">Came unto me together with its meaning</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>As soon as she was where the grasses are.</p>
<p class="slindent">Bathed by the waters of the beauteous river,</p>
<p class="slindent">To lift her eyes she granted me the boon.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I do not think there shone so great a light</p>
<p class="slindent">Under the lids of Venus, when transfixed</p>
<p class="slindent">By her own son, beyond his usual custom!</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Erect upon the other bank she smiled,</p>
<p class="slindent">Bearing full many colours in her hands,</p>
<p class="slindent">Which that high land produces without seed.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Apart three paces did the river make us;</p>
<p class="slindent">But Hellespont, where Xerxes passed across,</p>
<p class="slindent">(A curb still to all human arrogance,)</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>More hatred from Leander did not suffer</p>
<p class="slindent">For rolling between Sestos and Abydos,</p>
<p class="slindent">Than that from me, because it oped not then.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Ye are new-comers; and because I smile,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Began she, &ldquo;peradventure, in this place</p>
<p class="slindent">Elect to human nature for its nest,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Some apprehension keeps you marvelling;</p>
<p class="slindent">But the psalm &lsquo;Delectasti&rsquo; giveth light</p>
<p class="slindent">Which has the power to uncloud your intellect.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And thou who foremost art, and didst entreat me,</p>
<p class="slindent">Speak, if thou wouldst hear more; for I came ready</p>
<p class="slindent">To all thy questionings, as far as needful.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;The water,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and the forest&rsquo;s sound,</p>
<p class="slindent">Are combating within me my new faith</p>
<p class="slindent">In something which I heard opposed to this.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Whence she: &ldquo;I will relate how from its cause</p>
<p class="slindent">Proceedeth that which maketh thee to wonder,</p>
<p class="slindent">And purge away the cloud that smites upon thee.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The Good Supreme, sole in itself delighting,</p>
<p class="slindent">Created man good, and this goodly place</p>
<p class="slindent">Gave him as hansel of eternal peace.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>By his default short while he sojourned here;</p>
<p class="slindent">By his default to weeping and to toil</p>
<p class="slindent">He changed his innocent laughter and sweet play.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>That the disturbance which below is made</p>
<p class="slindent">By exhalations of the land and water,</p>
<p class="slindent">(Which far as may be follow after heat,)</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Might not upon mankind wage any war,</p>
<p class="slindent">This mount ascended tow&rsquo;rds the heaven so high,</p>
<p class="slindent">And is exempt, from there where it is locked.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Now since the universal atmosphere</p>
<p class="slindent">Turns in a circuit with the primal motion</p>
<p class="slindent">Unless the circle is broken on some side,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Upon this height, that all is disengaged</p>
<p class="slindent">In living ether, doth this motion strike</p>
<p class="slindent">And make the forest sound, for it is dense;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And so much power the stricken plant possesses</p>
<p class="slindent">That with its virtue it impregns the air,</p>
<p class="slindent">And this, revolving, scatters it around;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And yonder earth, according as &rsquo;tis worthy</p>
<p class="slindent">In self or in its clime, conceives and bears</p>
<p class="slindent">Of divers qualities the divers trees;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>It should not seem a marvel then on earth,</p>
<p class="slindent">This being heard, whenever any plant</p>
<p class="slindent">Without seed manifest there taketh root.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And thou must know, this holy table-land</p>
<p class="slindent">In which thou art is full of every seed,</p>
<p class="slindent">And fruit has in it never gathered there.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The water which thou seest springs not from vein</p>
<p class="slindent">Restored by vapour that the cold condenses,</p>
<p class="slindent">Like to a stream that gains or loses breath;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But issues from a fountain safe and certain,</p>
<p class="slindent">Which by the will of God as much regains</p>
<p class="slindent">As it discharges, open on two sides.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Upon this side with virtue it descends,</p>
<p class="slindent">Which takes away all memory of sin;</p>
<p class="slindent">On that, of every good deed done restores it.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Here Lethe, as upon the other side</p>
<p class="slindent">Eunoe, it is called; and worketh not</p>
<p class="slindent">If first on either side it be not tasted.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>This every other savour doth transcend;</p>
<p class="slindent">And notwithstanding slaked so far may be</p>
<p class="slindent">Thy thirst, that I reveal to thee no more,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I&rsquo;ll give thee a corollary still in grace,</p>
<p class="slindent">Nor think my speech will be to thee less dear</p>
<p class="slindent">If it spread out beyond my promise to thee.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Those who in ancient times have feigned in song</p>
<p class="slindent">The Age of Gold and its felicity,</p>
<p class="slindent">Dreamed of this place perhaps upon Parnassus.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Here was the human race in innocence;</p>
<p class="slindent">Here evermore was Spring, and every fruit;</p>
<p class="slindent">This is the nectar of which each one speaks.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then backward did I turn me wholly round</p>
<p class="slindent">Unto my Poets, and saw that with a smile</p>
<p class="slindent">They had been listening to these closing words;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then to the beautiful lady turned mine eyes.</p></div>`,

`<p class="cantohead">Purgatorio: Canto XXIX</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>Singing like unto an enamoured lady</p>
<p class="slindent">She, with the ending of her words, continued:</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Beati quorum tecta sunt peccata.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And even as Nymphs, that wandered all alone</p>
<p class="slindent">Among the sylvan shadows, sedulous</p>
<p class="slindent">One to avoid and one to see the sun,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>She then against the stream moved onward, going</p>
<p class="slindent">Along the bank, and I abreast of her,</p>
<p class="slindent">Her little steps with little steps attending.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Between her steps and mine were not a hundred,</p>
<p class="slindent">When equally the margins gave a turn,</p>
<p class="slindent">In such a way, that to the East I faced.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Nor even thus our way continued far</p>
<p class="slindent">Before the lady wholly turned herself</p>
<p class="slindent">Unto me, saying, &ldquo;Brother, look and listen!&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And lo! a sudden lustre ran across</p>
<p class="slindent">On every side athwart the spacious forest,</p>
<p class="slindent">Such that it made me doubt if it were lightning.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But since the lightning ceases as it comes,</p>
<p class="slindent">And that continuing brightened more and more,</p>
<p class="slindent">Within my thought I said, &ldquo;What thing is this?&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And a delicious melody there ran</p>
<p class="slindent">Along the luminous air, whence holy zeal</p>
<p class="slindent">Made me rebuke the hardihood of Eve;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>For there where earth and heaven obedient were,</p>
<p class="slindent">The woman only, and but just created,</p>
<p class="slindent">Could not endure to stay &rsquo;neath any veil;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Underneath which had she devoutly stayed,</p>
<p class="slindent">I sooner should have tasted those delights</p>
<p class="slindent">Ineffable, and for a longer time.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>While &rsquo;mid such manifold first-fruits I walked</p>
<p class="slindent">Of the eternal pleasure all enrapt,</p>
<p class="slindent">And still solicitous of more delights,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>In front of us like an enkindled fire</p>
<p class="slindent">Became the air beneath the verdant boughs,</p>
<p class="slindent">And the sweet sound as singing now was heard.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>O Virgins sacrosanct! if ever hunger,</p>
<p class="slindent">Vigils, or cold for you I have endured,</p>
<p class="slindent">The occasion spurs me their reward to claim!</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Now Helicon must needs pour forth for me,</p>
<p class="slindent">And with her choir Urania must assist me,</p>
<p class="slindent">To put in verse things difficult to think.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>A little farther on, seven trees of gold</p>
<p class="slindent">In semblance the long space still intervening</p>
<p class="slindent">Between ourselves and them did counterfeit;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But when I had approached so near to them</p>
<p class="slindent">The common object, which the sense deceives,</p>
<p class="slindent">Lost not by distance any of its marks,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The faculty that lends discourse to reason</p>
<p class="slindent">Did apprehend that they were candlesticks,</p>
<p class="slindent">And in the voices of the song &ldquo;Hosanna!&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Above them flamed the harness beautiful,</p>
<p class="slindent">Far brighter than the moon in the serene</p>
<p class="slindent">Of midnight, at the middle of her month.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I turned me round, with admiration filled,</p>
<p class="slindent">To good Virgilius, and he answered me</p>
<p class="slindent">With visage no less full of wonderment.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then back I turned my face to those high things,</p>
<p class="slindent">Which moved themselves towards us so sedately,</p>
<p class="slindent">They had been distanced by new-wedded brides.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The lady chid me: &ldquo;Why dost thou burn only</p>
<p class="slindent">So with affection for the living lights,</p>
<p class="slindent">And dost not look at what comes after them?&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then saw I people, as behind their leaders,</p>
<p class="slindent">Coming behind them, garmented in white,</p>
<p class="slindent">And such a whiteness never was on earth.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The water on my left flank was resplendent,</p>
<p class="slindent">And back to me reflected my left side,</p>
<p class="slindent">E&rsquo;en as a mirror, if I looked therein.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>When I upon my margin had such post</p>
<p class="slindent">That nothing but the stream divided us,</p>
<p class="slindent">Better to see I gave my steps repose;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And I beheld the flamelets onward go,</p>
<p class="slindent">Leaving behind themselves the air depicted,</p>
<p class="slindent">And they of trailing pennons had the semblance,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So that it overhead remained distinct</p>
<p class="slindent">With sevenfold lists, all of them of the colours</p>
<p class="slindent">Whence the sun&rsquo;s bow is made, and Delia&rsquo;s girdle.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>These standards to the rearward longer were</p>
<p class="slindent">Than was my sight; and, as it seemed to me,</p>
<p class="slindent">Ten paces were the outermost apart.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Under so fair a heaven as I describe</p>
<p class="slindent">The four and twenty Elders, two by two,</p>
<p class="slindent">Came on incoronate with flower-de-luce.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>They all of them were singing: &ldquo;Blessed thou</p>
<p class="slindent">Among the daughters of Adam art, and blessed</p>
<p class="slindent">For evermore shall be thy loveliness.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>After the flowers and other tender grasses</p>
<p class="slindent">In front of me upon the other margin</p>
<p class="slindent">Were disencumbered of that race elect,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Even as in heaven star followeth after star,</p>
<p class="slindent">There came close after them four animals,</p>
<p class="slindent">Incoronate each one with verdant leaf.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Plumed with six wings was every one of them,</p>
<p class="slindent">The plumage full of eyes; the eyes of Argus</p>
<p class="slindent">If they were living would be such as these.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Reader! to trace their forms no more I waste</p>
<p class="slindent">My rhymes; for other spendings press me so,</p>
<p class="slindent">That I in this cannot be prodigal.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But read Ezekiel, who depicteth them</p>
<p class="slindent">As he beheld them from the region cold</p>
<p class="slindent">Coming with cloud, with whirlwind, and with fire;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And such as thou shalt find them in his pages,</p>
<p class="slindent">Such were they here; saving that in their plumage</p>
<p class="slindent">John is with me, and differeth from him.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The interval between these four contained</p>
<p class="slindent">A chariot triumphal on two wheels,</p>
<p class="slindent">Which by a Griffin&rsquo;s neck came drawn along;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And upward he extended both his wings</p>
<p class="slindent">Between the middle list and three and three,</p>
<p class="slindent">So that he injured none by cleaving it.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So high they rose that they were lost to sight;</p>
<p class="slindent">His limbs were gold, so far as he was bird,</p>
<p class="slindent">And white the others with vermilion mingled.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Not only Rome with no such splendid car</p>
<p class="slindent">E&rsquo;et gladdened Africanus, or Augustus,</p>
<p class="slindent">But poor to it that of the Sun would be,—</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>That of the Sun, which swerving was burnt up</p>
<p class="slindent">At the importunate orison of Earth,</p>
<p class="slindent">When Jove was so mysteriously just.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Three maidens at the right wheel in a circle</p>
<p class="slindent">Came onward dancing; one so very red</p>
<p class="slindent">That in the fire she hardly had been noted.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The second was as if her flesh and bones</p>
<p class="slindent">Had all been fashioned out of emerald;</p>
<p class="slindent">The third appeared as snow but newly fallen.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And now they seemed conducted by the white,</p>
<p class="slindent">Now by the red, and from the song of her</p>
<p class="slindent">The others took their step, or slow or swift.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Upon the left hand four made holiday</p>
<p class="slindent">Vested in purple, following the measure</p>
<p class="slindent">Of one of them with three eyes m her head.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>In rear of all the group here treated of</p>
<p class="slindent">Two old men I beheld, unlike in habit,</p>
<p class="slindent">But like in gait, each dignified and grave.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>One showed himself as one of the disciples</p>
<p class="slindent">Of that supreme Hippocrates, whom nature</p>
<p class="slindent">Made for the animals she holds most dear;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Contrary care the other manifested,</p>
<p class="slindent">With sword so shining and so sharp, it caused</p>
<p class="slindent">Terror to me on this side of the river.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thereafter four I saw of humble aspect,</p>
<p class="slindent">And behind all an aged man alone</p>
<p class="slindent">Walking in sleep with countenance acute.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And like the foremost company these seven</p>
<p class="slindent">Were habited; yet of the flower-de-luce</p>
<p class="slindent">No garland round about the head they wore,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But of the rose, and other flowers vermilion;</p>
<p class="slindent">At little distance would the sight have sworn</p>
<p class="slindent">That all were in a flame above their brows.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And when the car was opposite to me</p>
<p class="slindent">Thunder was heard; and all that folk august</p>
<p class="slindent">Seemed to have further progress interdicted,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>There with the vanward ensigns standing still.</p></div>`,

`<p class="cantohead">Purgatorio: Canto XXX</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>When the Septentrion of the highest heaven</p>
<p class="slindent">(Which never either setting knew or rising,</p>
<p class="slindent">Nor veil of other cloud than that of sin,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And which made every one therein aware</p>
<p class="slindent">Of his own duty, as the lower makes</p>
<p class="slindent">Whoever turns the helm to come to port)</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Motionless halted, the veracious people,</p>
<p class="slindent">That came at first between it and the Griffin,</p>
<p class="slindent">Turned themselves to the car, as to their peace.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And one of them, as if by Heaven commissioned,</p>
<p class="slindent">Singing, &ldquo;Veni, sponsa, de Libano&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Shouted three times, and all the others after.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Even as the Blessed at the final summons</p>
<p class="slindent">Shall rise up quickened each one from his cavern,</p>
<p class="slindent">Uplifting light the reinvested flesh,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So upon that celestial chariot</p>
<p class="slindent">A hundred rose &lsquo;ad vocem tanti senis,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Ministers and messengers of life eternal.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>They all were saying, &ldquo;Benedictus qui venis,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">And, scattering flowers above and round about,</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Manibus o date lilia plenis.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Ere now have I beheld, as day began,</p>
<p class="slindent">The eastern hemisphere all tinged with rose,</p>
<p class="slindent">And the other heaven with fair serene adorned;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And the sun&rsquo;s face, uprising, overshadowed</p>
<p class="slindent">So that by tempering influence of vapours</p>
<p class="slindent">For a long interval the eye sustained it;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thus in the bosom of a cloud of flowers</p>
<p class="slindent">Which from those hands angelical ascended,</p>
<p class="slindent">And downward fell again inside and out,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Over her snow-white veil with olive cinct</p>
<p class="slindent">Appeared a lady under a green mantle,</p>
<p class="slindent">Vested in colour of the living flame.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And my own spirit, that already now</p>
<p class="slindent">So long a time had been, that in her presence</p>
<p class="slindent">Trembling with awe it had not stood abashed,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Without more knowledge having by mine eyes,</p>
<p class="slindent">Through occult virtue that from her proceeded</p>
<p class="slindent">Of ancient love the mighty influence felt.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>As soon as on my vision smote the power</p>
<p class="slindent">Sublime, that had already pierced me through</p>
<p class="slindent">Ere from my boyhood I had yet come forth,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>To the left hand I turned with that reliance</p>
<p class="slindent">With which the little child runs to his mother,</p>
<p class="slindent">When he has fear, or when he is afflicted,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>To say unto Virgilius: &ldquo;Not a drachm</p>
<p class="slindent">Of blood remains in me, that does not tremble;</p>
<p class="slindent">I know the traces of the ancient flame.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But us Virgilius of himself deprived</p>
<p class="slindent">Had left, Virgilius, sweetest of all fathers,</p>
<p class="slindent">Virgilius, to whom I for safety gave me:</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Nor whatsoever lost the ancient mother</p>
<p class="slindent">Availed my cheeks now purified from dew,</p>
<p class="slindent">That weeping they should not again be darkened.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Dante, because Virgilius has departed</p>
<p class="slindent">Do not weep yet, do not weep yet awhile;</p>
<p class="slindent">For by another sword thou need&rsquo;st must weep.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>E&rsquo;en as an admiral, who on poop and prow</p>
<p class="slindent">Comes to behold the people that are working</p>
<p class="slindent">In other ships, and cheers them to well-doing,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Upon the left hand border of the car,</p>
<p class="slindent">When at the sound I turned of my own name,</p>
<p class="slindent">Which of necessity is here recorded,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I saw the Lady, who erewhile appeared</p>
<p class="slindent">Veiled underneath the angelic festival,</p>
<p class="slindent">Direct her eyes to me across the river.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Although the veil, that from her head descended,</p>
<p class="slindent">Encircled with the foliage of Minerva,</p>
<p class="slindent">Did not permit her to appear distinctly,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>In attitude still royally majestic</p>
<p class="slindent">Continued she, like unto one who speaks,</p>
<p class="slindent">And keeps his warmest utterance in reserve:</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Look at me well; in sooth I&rsquo;m Beatrice!</p>
<p class="slindent">How didst thou deign to come unto the Mountain?</p>
<p class="slindent">Didst thou not know that man is happy here?&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Mine eyes fell downward into the clear fountain,</p>
<p class="slindent">But, seeing myself therein, I sought the grass,</p>
<p class="slindent">So great a shame did weigh my forehead down.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>As to the son the mother seems superb,</p>
<p class="slindent">So she appeared to me; for somewhat bitter</p>
<p class="slindent">Tasteth the savour of severe compassion.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Silent became she, and the Angels sang</p>
<p class="slindent">Suddenly, &ldquo;In te, Domine, speravi:&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">But beyond &lsquo;pedes meos&rsquo; did not pass.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Even as the snow among the living rafters</p>
<p class="slindent">Upon the back of Italy congeals,</p>
<p class="slindent">Blown on and drifted by Sclavonian winds,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And then, dissolving, trickles through itself</p>
<p class="slindent">Whene&rsquo;et the land that loses shadow breathes,</p>
<p class="slindent">So that it seems a fire that melts a taper;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>E&rsquo;en thus was I without a tear or sigh,</p>
<p class="slindent">Before the song of those who sing for ever</p>
<p class="slindent">After the music of the eternal spheres.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But when I heard in their sweet melodies</p>
<p class="slindent">Compassion for me, more than had they said,</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;O wherefore, lady, dost thou thus upbraid him?&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The ice, that was about my heart congealed,</p>
<p class="slindent">To air and water changed, and in my anguish</p>
<p class="slindent">Through mouth and eyes came gushing from my breast.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>She, on the right-hand border of the car</p>
<p class="slindent">Still firmly standing, to those holy beings</p>
<p class="slindent">Thus her discourse directed afterwards:</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Ye keep your watch in the eternal day,</p>
<p class="slindent">So that nor night nor sleep can steal from you</p>
<p class="slindent">One step the ages make upon their path;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Therefore my answer is with greater care,</p>
<p class="slindent">That he may hear me who is weeping yonder,</p>
<p class="slindent">So that the sin and dole be of one measure.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Not only by the work of those great wheels,</p>
<p class="slindent">That destine every seed unto some end,</p>
<p class="slindent">According as the stars are in conjunction,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But by the largess of celestial graces,</p>
<p class="slindent">Which have such lofty vapours for their rain</p>
<p class="slindent">That near to them our sight approaches not,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Such had this man become in his new life</p>
<p class="slindent">Potentially, that every righteous habit</p>
<p class="slindent">Would have made admirable proof in him;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But so much more malignant and more savage</p>
<p class="slindent">Becomes the land untilled and with bad seed,</p>
<p class="slindent">The more good earthly vigour it possesses.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Some time did I sustain him with my look;</p>
<p class="slindent">Revealing unto him my youthful eyes,</p>
<p class="slindent">I led him with me turned in the right way.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>As soon as ever of my second age</p>
<p class="slindent">I was upon the threshold and changed life,</p>
<p class="slindent">Himself from me he took and gave to others.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>When from the flesh to spirit I ascended,</p>
<p class="slindent">And beauty and virtue were in me increased,</p>
<p class="slindent">I was to him less dear and less delightful;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And into ways untrue he turned his steps,</p>
<p class="slindent">Pursuing the false images of good,</p>
<p class="slindent">That never any promises fulfil;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Nor prayer for inspiration me availed,</p>
<p class="slindent">By means of which in dreams and otherwise</p>
<p class="slindent">I called him back, so little did he heed them.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So low he fell, that all appliances</p>
<p class="slindent">For his salvation were already short,</p>
<p class="slindent">Save showing him the people of perdition.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>For this I visited the gates of death,</p>
<p class="slindent">And unto him, who so far up has led him,</p>
<p class="slindent">My intercessions were with weeping borne.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>God&rsquo;s lofty fiat would be violated,</p>
<p class="slindent">If Lethe should be passed, and if such viands</p>
<p class="slindent">Should tasted be, withouten any scot</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Of penitence, that gushes forth in tears.&rdquo;</p></div>`,

`<p class="cantohead">Purgatorio: Canto XXXI</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;O thou who art beyond the sacred river,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Turning to me the point of her discourse,</p>
<p class="slindent">That edgewise even had seemed to me so keen,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>She recommenced, continuing without pause,</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Say, say if this be true; to such a charge,</p>
<p class="slindent">Thy own confession needs must be conjoined.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>My faculties were in so great confusion,</p>
<p class="slindent">That the voice moved, but sooner was extinct</p>
<p class="slindent">Than by its organs it was set at large.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Awhile she waited; then she said: &ldquo;What thinkest?</p>
<p class="slindent">Answer me; for the mournful memories</p>
<p class="slindent">In thee not yet are by the waters injured.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Confusion and dismay together mingled</p>
<p class="slindent">Forced such a Yes! from out my mouth, that sight</p>
<p class="slindent">Was needful to the understanding of it.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Even as a cross-bow breaks, when &rsquo;tis discharged</p>
<p class="slindent">Too tensely drawn the bowstring and the bow,</p>
<p class="slindent">And with less force the arrow hits the mark,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So I gave way beneath that heavy burden,</p>
<p class="slindent">Outpouring in a torrent tears and sighs,</p>
<p class="slindent">And the voice flagged upon its passage forth.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Whence she to me: &ldquo;In those desires of mine</p>
<p class="slindent">Which led thee to the loving of that good,</p>
<p class="slindent">Beyond which there is nothing to aspire to,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>What trenches lying traverse or what chains</p>
<p class="slindent">Didst thou discover, that of passing onward</p>
<p class="slindent">Thou shouldst have thus despoiled thee of the hope?</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And what allurements or what vantages</p>
<p class="slindent">Upon the forehead of the others showed,</p>
<p class="slindent">That thou shouldst turn thy footsteps unto them?&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>After the heaving of a bitter sigh,</p>
<p class="slindent">Hardly had I the voice to make response,</p>
<p class="slindent">And with fatigue my lips did fashion it.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Weeping I said: &ldquo;The things that present were</p>
<p class="slindent">With their false pleasure turned aside my steps,</p>
<p class="slindent">Soon as your countenance concealed itself.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And she: &ldquo;Shouldst thou be silent, or deny</p>
<p class="slindent">What thou confessest, not less manifest</p>
<p class="slindent">Would be thy fault, by such a Judge &rsquo;tis known.</p></div>

<p class="slindent">The accusal of the sin, in our tribunal</p>

<p class="slindent">For thy transgression, and another time</p>
<p class="slindent">Hearing the Sirens thou mayst be more strong,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Cast down the seed of weeping and attend;</p>
<p class="slindent">So shalt thou hear, how in an opposite way</p>
<p class="slindent">My buried flesh should have directed thee.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Never to thee presented art or nature</p>
<p class="slindent">Pleasure so great as the fair limbs wherein</p>
<p class="slindent">I was enclosed, which scattered are in earth.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And if the highest pleasure thus did fail thee</p>
<p class="slindent">By reason of my death, what mortal thing</p>
<p class="slindent">Should then have drawn thee into its desire?</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thou oughtest verily at the first shaft</p>
<p class="slindent">Of things fallacious to have risen up</p>
<p class="slindent">To follow me, who was no longer such.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thou oughtest not to have stooped thy pinions downward</p>
<p class="slindent">To wait for further blows, or little girl,</p>
<p class="slindent">Or other vanity of such brief use.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The callow birdlet waits for two or three,</p>
<p class="slindent">But to the eyes of those already fledged,</p>
<p class="slindent">In vain the net is spread or shaft is shot.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Even as children silent in their shame</p>
<p class="slindent">Stand listening with their eyes upon the ground,</p>
<p class="slindent">And conscious of their fault, and penitent;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So was I standing; and she said: &ldquo;If thou</p>
<p class="slindent">In hearing sufferest pain, lift up thy beard</p>
<p class="slindent">And thou shalt feel a greater pain in seeing.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>With less resistance is a robust holm</p>
<p class="slindent">Uprooted, either by a native wind</p>
<p class="slindent">Or else by that from regions of Iarbas,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Than I upraised at her command my chin;</p>
<p class="slindent">And when she by the beard the face demanded,</p>
<p class="slindent">Well I perceived the venom of her meaning.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And as my countenance was lifted up,</p>
<p class="slindent">Mine eye perceived those creatures beautiful</p>
<p class="slindent">Had rested from the strewing of the flowers;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And, still but little reassured, mine eyes</p>
<p class="slindent">Saw Beatrice turned round towards the monster,</p>
<p class="slindent">That is one person only in two natures.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Beneath her veil, beyond the margent green,</p>
<p class="slindent">She seemed to me far more her ancient self</p>
<p class="slindent">To excel, than others here, when she was here.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So pricked me then the thorn of penitence,</p>
<p class="slindent">That of all other things the one which turned me</p>
<p class="slindent">Most to its love became the most my foe.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Such self-conviction stung me at the heart</p>
<p class="slindent">O&rsquo;etpowered I fell, and what I then became</p>
<p class="slindent">She knoweth who had furnished me the cause.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then, when the heart restored my outward sense,</p>
<p class="slindent">The lady I had found alone, above me</p>
<p class="slindent">I saw, and she was saying, &ldquo;Hold me, hold me.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Up to my throat she in the stream had drawn me,</p>
<p class="slindent">And, dragging me behind her, she was moving</p>
<p class="slindent">Upon the water lightly as a shuttle.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>When I was near unto the blessed shore,</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Asperges me,&rdquo; I heard so sweetly sung,</p>
<p class="slindent">Remember it I cannot, much less write it.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The beautiful lady opened wide her arms,</p>
<p class="slindent">Embraced my head, and plunged me underneath,</p>
<p class="slindent">Where I was forced to swallow of the water.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then forth she drew me, and all dripping brought</p>
<p class="slindent">Into the dance of the four beautiful,</p>
<p class="slindent">And each one with her arm did cover me.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&rsquo;We here are Nymphs, and in the Heaven are stars;</p>
<p class="slindent">Ere Beatrice descended to the world,</p>
<p class="slindent">We as her handmaids were appointed her.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>We&rsquo;ll lead thee to her eyes; but for the pleasant</p>
<p class="slindent">Light that within them is, shall sharpen thine</p>
<p class="slindent">The three beyond, who more profoundly look.&rsquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thus singing they began; and afterwards</p>
<p class="slindent">Unto the Griffin&rsquo;s breast they led me with them,</p>
<p class="slindent">Where Beatrice was standing, turned towards us.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;See that thou dost not spare thine eyes,&rdquo; they said;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Before the emeralds have we stationed thee,</p>
<p class="slindent">Whence Love aforetime drew for thee his weapons.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>A thousand longings, hotter than the flame,</p>
<p class="slindent">Fastened mine eyes upon those eyes relucent,</p>
<p class="slindent">That still upon the Griffin steadfast stayed.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>As in a glass the sun, not otherwise</p>
<p class="slindent">Within them was the twofold monster shining,</p>
<p class="slindent">Now with the one, now with the other nature.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Think, Reader, if within myself I marvelled,</p>
<p class="slindent">When I beheld the thing itself stand still,</p>
<p class="slindent">And in its image it transformed itself.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>While with amazement filled and jubilant,</p>
<p class="slindent">My soul was tasting of the food, that while</p>
<p class="slindent">It satisfies us makes us hunger for it,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Themselves revealing of the highest rank</p>
<p class="slindent">In bearing, did the other three advance,</p>
<p class="slindent">Singing to their angelic saraband.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Turn, Beatrice, O turn thy holy eyes,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Such was their song, &ldquo;unto thy faithful one,</p>
<p class="slindent">Who has to see thee ta&rsquo;en so many steps.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>In grace do us the grace that thou unveil</p>
<p class="slindent">Thy face to him, so that he may discern</p>
<p class="slindent">The second beauty which thou dost conceal.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>O splendour of the living light eternal!</p>
<p class="slindent">Who underneath the shadow of Parnassus</p>
<p class="slindent">Has grown so pale, or drunk so at its cistern,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>He would not seem to have his mind encumbered</p>
<p class="slindent">Striving to paint thee as thou didst appear,</p>
<p class="slindent">Where the harmonious heaven o&rsquo;etshadowed thee,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>When in the open air thou didst unveil?</p></div>`,

`<p class="cantohead">Purgatorio: Canto XXXII</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>So steadfast and attentive were mine eyes</p>
<p class="slindent">In satisfying their decennial thirst,</p>
<p class="slindent">That all my other senses were extinct,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And upon this side and on that they had</p>
<p class="slindent">Walls of indifference, so the holy smile</p>
<p class="slindent">Drew them unto itself with the old net</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>When forcibly my sight was turned away</p>
<p class="slindent">Towards my left hand by those goddesses,</p>
<p class="slindent">Because I heard from them a &ldquo;Too intently!&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And that condition of the sight which is</p>
<p class="slindent">In eyes but lately smitten by the sun</p>
<p class="slindent">Bereft me of my vision some short while;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But to the less when sight re-shaped itself,</p>
<p class="slindent">I say the less in reference to the greater</p>
<p class="slindent">Splendour from which perforce I had withdrawn,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I saw upon its right wing wheeled about</p>
<p class="slindent">The glorious host returning with the sun</p>
<p class="slindent">And with the sevenfold flames upon their faces.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>As underneath its shields, to save itself,</p>
<p class="slindent">A squadron turns, and with its banner wheels,</p>
<p class="slindent">Before the whole thereof can change its front,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>That soldiery of the celestial kingdom</p>
<p class="slindent">Which marched in the advance had wholly passed us</p>
<p class="slindent">Before the chariot had turned its pole.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then to the wheels the maidens turned themselves,</p>
<p class="slindent">And the Griffin moved his burden benedight,</p>
<p class="slindent">But so that not a feather of him fluttered.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The lady fair who drew me through the ford</p>
<p class="slindent">Followed with Statius and myself the wheel</p>
<p class="slindent">Which made its orbit with the lesser arc.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So passing through the lofty forest, vacant</p>
<p class="slindent">By fault of her who in the serpent trusted,</p>
<p class="slindent">Angelic music made our steps keep time.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Perchance as great a space had in three flights</p>
<p class="slindent">An arrow loosened from the string o&rsquo;etpassed,</p>
<p class="slindent">As we had moved when Beatrice descended.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I heard them murmur altogether, &ldquo;Adam!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Then circled they about a tree despoiled</p>
<p class="slindent">Of blooms and other leafage on each bough.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Its tresses, which so much the more dilate</p>
<p class="slindent">As higher they ascend, had been by Indians</p>
<p class="slindent">Among their forests marvelled at for height.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Blessed art thou, O Griffin, who dost not</p>
<p class="slindent">Pluck with thy beak these branches sweet to taste,</p>
<p class="slindent">Since appetite by this was turned to evil.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>After this fashion round the tree robust</p>
<p class="slindent">The others shouted; and the twofold creature:</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Thus is preserved the seed of all the just.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And turning to the pole which he had dragged,</p>
<p class="slindent">He drew it close beneath the widowed bough,</p>
<p class="slindent">And what was of it unto it left bound.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>In the same manner as our trees (when downward</p>
<p class="slindent">Falls the great light, with that together mingled</p>
<p class="slindent">Which after the celestial Lasca shines)</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Begin to swell, and then renew themselves,</p>
<p class="slindent">Each one with its own colour, ere the Sun</p>
<p class="slindent">Harness his steeds beneath another star:</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Less than of rose and more than violet</p>
<p class="slindent">A hue disclosing, was renewed the tree</p>
<p class="slindent">That had erewhile its boughs so desolate.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I never heard, nor here below is sung,</p>
<p class="slindent">The hymn which afterward that people sang,</p>
<p class="slindent">Nor did I bear the melody throughout.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Had I the power to paint how fell asleep</p>
<p class="slindent">Those eyes compassionless, of Syrinx hearing,</p>
<p class="slindent">Those eyes to which more watching cost so dear,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Even as a painter who from model paints</p>
<p class="slindent">I would portray how I was lulled asleep;</p>
<p class="slindent">He may, who well can picture drowsihood.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Therefore I pass to what time I awoke,</p>
<p class="slindent">And say a splendour rent from me the veil</p>
<p class="slindent">Of slumber, and a calling: &ldquo;Rise, what dost thou?&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>As to behold the apple-tree in blossom</p>
<p class="slindent">Which makes the Angels greedy for its fruit,</p>
<p class="slindent">And keeps perpetual bridals in the Heaven,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Peter and John and James conducted were,</p>
<p class="slindent">And, overcome, recovered at the word</p>
<p class="slindent">By which still greater slumbers have been broken,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And saw their school diminished by the loss</p>
<p class="slindent">Not only of Elias, but of Moses,</p>
<p class="slindent">And the apparel of their Master changed;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So I revived, and saw that piteous one</p>
<p class="slindent">Above me standing, who had been conductress</p>
<p class="slindent">Aforetime of my steps beside the river,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And all in doubt I said, &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Beatrice?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">And she: &ldquo;Behold her seated underneath</p>
<p class="slindent">The leafage new, upon the root of it.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Behold the company that circles her;</p>
<p class="slindent">The rest behind the Griffin are ascending</p>
<p class="slindent">With more melodious song, and more profound.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And if her speech were more diffuse I know not,</p>
<p class="slindent">Because already in my sight was she</p>
<p class="slindent">Who from the hearing of aught else had shut me.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Alone she sat upon the very earth,</p>
<p class="slindent">Left there as guardian of the chariot</p>
<p class="slindent">Which I had seen the biform monster fasten.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Encircling her, a cloister made themselves</p>
<p class="slindent">The seven Nymphs, with those lights in their hands</p>
<p class="slindent">Which are secure from Aquilon and Auster.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Short while shalt thou be here a forester,</p>
<p class="slindent">And thou shalt be with me for evermore</p>
<p class="slindent">A citizen of that Rome where Christ is Roman.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Therefore, for that world&rsquo;s good which liveth ill,</p>
<p class="slindent">Fix on the car thine eyes, and what thou seest,</p>
<p class="slindent">Having returned to earth, take heed thou write.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thus Beatrice; and I, who at the feet</p>
<p class="slindent">Of her commandments all devoted was,</p>
<p class="slindent">My mind and eyes directed where she willed.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Never descended with so swift a motion</p>
<p class="slindent">Fire from a heavy cloud, when it is raining</p>
<p class="slindent">From out the region which is most remote,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>As I beheld the bird of Jove descend</p>
<p class="slindent">Down through the tree, rending away the bark,</p>
<p class="slindent">As well as blossoms and the foliage new,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And he with all his might the chariot smote,</p>
<p class="slindent">Whereat it reeled, like vessel in a tempest</p>
<p class="slindent">Tossed by the waves, now starboard and now larboard.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thereafter saw I leap into the body</p>
<p class="slindent">Of the triumphal vehicle a Fox,</p>
<p class="slindent">That seemed unfed with any wholesome food.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But for his hideous sins upbraiding him,</p>
<p class="slindent">My Lady put him to as swift a flight</p>
<p class="slindent">As such a fleshless skeleton could bear.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then by the way that it before had come,</p>
<p class="slindent">Into the chariot&rsquo;s chest I saw the Eagle</p>
<p class="slindent">Descend, and leave it feathered with his plumes.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And such as issues from a heart that mourns,</p>
<p class="slindent">A voice from Heaven there issued, and it said:</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;My little bark, how badly art thou freighted!&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Methought, then, that the earth did yawn between</p>
<p class="slindent">Both wheels, and I saw rise from it a Dragon,</p>
<p class="slindent">Who through the chariot upward fixed his tail,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And as a wasp that draweth back its sting,</p>
<p class="slindent">Drawing unto himself his tail malign,</p>
<p class="slindent">Drew out the floor, and went his way rejoicing.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>That which remained behind, even as with grass</p>
<p class="slindent">A fertile region, with the feathers, offered</p>
<p class="slindent">Perhaps with pure intention and benign,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Reclothed itself, and with them were reclothed</p>
<p class="slindent">The pole and both the wheels so speedily,</p>
<p class="slindent">A sigh doth longer keep the lips apart.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Transfigured thus the holy edifice</p>
<p class="slindent">Thrust forward heads upon the parts of it,</p>
<p class="slindent">Three on the pole and one at either corner.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The first were horned like oxen; but the four</p>
<p class="slindent">Had but a single horn upon the forehead;</p>
<p class="slindent">A monster such had never yet been seen!</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Firm as a rock upon a mountain high,</p>
<p class="slindent">Seated upon it, there appeared to me</p>
<p class="slindent">A shameless whore, with eyes swift glancing round,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And, as if not to have her taken from him,</p>
<p class="slindent">Upright beside her I beheld a giant;</p>
<p class="slindent">And ever and anon they kissed each other.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But because she her wanton, roving eye</p>
<p class="slindent">Turned upon me, her angry paramour</p>
<p class="slindent">Did scourge her from her head unto her feet.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then full of jealousy, and fierce with wrath,</p>
<p class="slindent">He loosed the monster, and across the forest</p>
<p class="slindent">Dragged it so far, he made of that alone</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>A shield unto the whore and the strange beast.</p></div>`,

`<p class="cantohead">Purgatorio: Canto XXXIII</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>And Beatrice, compassionate and sighing,</p>
<p class="slindent">Listened to them with such a countenance,</p>
<p class="slindent">That scarce more changed was Mary at the cross.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But when the other virgins place had given</p>
<p class="slindent">For her to speak, uprisen to her feet</p>

<p class="slindent">Think that God&rsquo;s vengeance does not fear a sop.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Without an heir shall not for ever be</p>
<p class="slindent">The Eagle that left his plumes upon the car,</p>
<p class="slindent">Whence it became a monster, then a prey;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>For verily I see, and hence narrate it,</p>
<p class="slindent">The stars already near to bring the time,</p>
<p class="slindent">From every hindrance safe, and every bar,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Within which a Five-hundred, Ten, and Five,</p>
<p class="slindent">One sent from God, shall slay the thievish woman</p>
<p class="slindent">And that same giant who is sinning with her.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And peradventure my dark utterance,</p>
<p class="slindent">Like Themis and the Sphinx, may less persuade thee,</p>
<p class="slindent">Since, in their mode, it clouds the intellect;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But soon the facts shall be the Naiades</p>
<p class="slindent">Who shall this difficult enigma solve,</p>
<p class="slindent">Without destruction of the flocks and harvests.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Note thou; and even as by me are uttered</p>
<p class="slindent">These words, so teach them unto those who live</p>
<p class="slindent">That life which is a running unto death;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And bear in mind, whene&rsquo;et thou writest them,</p>
<p class="slindent">Not to conceal what thou hast seen the plant,</p>
<p class="slindent">That twice already has been pillaged here.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Whoever pillages or shatters it,</p>
<p class="slindent">With blasphemy of deed offendeth God,</p>
<p class="slindent">Who made it holy for his use alone.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>For biting that, in pain and in desire</p>
<p class="slindent">Five thousand years and more the first-born soul</p>
<p class="slindent">Craved Him, who punished in himself the bite.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thy genius slumbers, if it deem it not</p>
<p class="slindent">For special reason so pre-eminent</p>
<p class="slindent">In height, and so inverted in its summit.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And if thy vain imaginings had not been</p>
<p class="slindent">Water of Elsa round about thy mind,</p>
<p class="slindent">And Pyramus to the mulberry, their pleasure,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thou by so many circumstances only</p>
<p class="slindent">The justice of the interdict of God</p>
<p class="slindent">Morally in the tree wouldst recognize.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But since I see thee in thine intellect</p>
<p class="slindent">Converted into stone and stained with sin,</p>
<p class="slindent">So that the light of my discourse doth daze thee,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I will too, if not written, at least painted,</p>
<p class="slindent">Thou bear it back within thee, for the reason</p>
<p class="slindent">That cinct with palm the pilgrim&rsquo;s staff is borne.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And I: &ldquo;As by a signet is the wax</p>
<p class="slindent">Which does not change the figure stamped upon it,</p>
<p class="slindent">My brain is now imprinted by yourself.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But wherefore so beyond my power of sight</p>
<p class="slindent">Soars your desirable discourse, that aye</p>
<p class="slindent">The more I strive, so much the more I lose it?&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;That thou mayst recognize,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the school</p>
<p class="slindent">Which thou hast followed, and mayst see how far</p>
<p class="slindent">Its doctrine follows after my discourse,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And mayst behold your path from the divine</p>
<p class="slindent">Distant as far as separated is</p>
<p class="slindent">From earth the heaven that highest hastens on.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Whence her I answered: &ldquo;I do not remember</p>
<p class="slindent">That ever I estranged myself from you,</p>
<p class="slindent">Nor have I conscience of it that reproves me.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;And if thou art not able to remember,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Smiling she answered, &ldquo;recollect thee now</p>
<p class="slindent">That thou this very day hast drunk of Lethe;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And if from smoke a fire may be inferred,</p>
<p class="slindent">Such an oblivion clearly demonstrates</p>
<p class="slindent">Some error in thy will elsewhere intent.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Truly from this time forward shall my words</p>
<p class="slindent">Be naked, so far as it is befitting</p>
<p class="slindent">To lay them open unto thy rude gaze.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And more coruscant and with slower steps</p>
<p class="slindent">The sun was holding the meridian circle,</p>
<p class="slindent">Which, with the point of view, shifts here and there</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>When halted (as he cometh to a halt,</p>
<p class="slindent">Who goes before a squadron as its escort,</p>
<p class="slindent">If something new he find upon his way)</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The ladies seven at a dark shadow&rsquo;s edge,</p>
<p class="slindent">Such as, beneath green leaves and branches black,</p>
<p class="slindent">The Alp upon its frigid border wears.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>In front of them the Tigris and Euphrates</p>
<p class="slindent">Methought I saw forth issue from one fountain,</p>
<p class="slindent">And slowly part, like friends, from one another.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;O light, O glory of the human race!</p>
<p class="slindent">What stream is this which here unfolds itself</p>
<p class="slindent">From out one source, and from itself withdraws?&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>For such a prayer, &rsquo;twas said unto me, &ldquo;Pray</p>
<p class="slindent">Matilda that she tell thee;&rdquo; and here answered,</p>
<p class="slindent">As one does who doth free himself from blame,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The beautiful lady: &ldquo;This and other things</p>
<p class="slindent">Were told to him by me; and sure I am</p>
<p class="slindent">The water of Lethe has not hid them from him.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And Beatrice: &ldquo;Perhaps a greater care,</p>
<p class="slindent">Which oftentimes our memory takes away,</p>
<p class="slindent">Has made the vision of his mind obscure.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But Eunoe behold, that yonder rises;</p>
<p class="slindent">Lead him to it, and, as thou art accustomed,</p>
<p class="slindent">Revive again the half-dead virtue in him.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Like gentle soul, that maketh no excuse,</p>
<p class="slindent">But makes its own will of another&rsquo;s will</p>
<p class="slindent">As soon as by a sign it is disclosed,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Even so, when she had taken hold of me,</p>
<p class="slindent">The beautiful lady moved, and unto Statius</p>
<p class="slindent">Said, in her womanly manner, &ldquo;Come with him.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>If, Reader, I possessed a longer space</p>
<p class="slindent">For writing it, I yet would sing in part</p>
<p class="slindent">Of the sweet draught that ne&rsquo;et would satiate me;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But inasmuch as full are all the leaves</p>
<p class="slindent">Made ready for this second canticle,</p>
<p class="slindent">The curb of art no farther lets me go.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>From the most holy water I returned</p>
<p class="slindent">Regenerate, in the manner of new trees</p>
<p class="slindent">That are renewed with a new foliage,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Pure and disposed to mount unto the stars.</p></div>`]
