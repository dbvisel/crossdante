		`<p class="cantohead">Canto I</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>His glory, by whose might all things are mov&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>Pierces the universe, and in one part</p>
<p>Sheds more resplendence, elsewhere less. In heav&rsquo;n,</p>
<p>That largeliest of his light partakes, was I,</p>
<p>Witness of things, which to relate again</p>
<p>Surpasseth power of him who comes from thence;</p>
<p>For that, so near approaching its desire</p>
<p>Our intellect is to such depth absorb&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>That memory cannot follow. Nathless all,</p>
<p>That in my thoughts I of that sacred realm</p>
<p>Could store, shall now be matter of my song.</p>
<p class="slindent">Benign Apollo! this last labour aid,</p>
<p>And make me such a vessel of thy worth,</p>
<p>As thy own laurel claims of me belov&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>Thus far hath one of steep Parnassus&rsquo; brows</p>
<p>Suffic&rsquo;d me; henceforth there is need of both</p>
<p>For my remaining enterprise Do thou</p>
<p>Enter into my bosom, and there breathe</p>
<p>So, as when Marsyas by thy hand was dragg&rsquo;d</p>
<p>Forth from his limbs unsheath&rsquo;d. O power divine!</p>
<p>If thou to me of shine impart so much,</p>
<p>That of that happy realm the shadow&rsquo;d form</p>
<p>Trac&rsquo;d in my thoughts I may set forth to view,</p>
<p>Thou shalt behold me of thy favour&rsquo;d tree</p>
<p>Come to the foot, and crown myself with leaves;</p>
<p>For to that honour thou, and my high theme</p>
<p>Will fit me. If but seldom, mighty Sire!</p>
<p>To grace his triumph gathers thence a wreath</p>
<p>Caesar or bard (more shame for human wills</p>
<p>Deprav&rsquo;d) joy to the Delphic god must spring</p>
<p>From the Pierian foliage, when one breast</p>
<p>Is with such thirst inspir&rsquo;d. From a small spark</p>
<p>Great flame hath risen: after me perchance</p>
<p>Others with better voice may pray, and gain</p>
<p>From the Cirrhaean city answer kind.</p>
<p class="slindent">Through diver passages, the world&rsquo;s bright lamp</p>
<p>Rises to mortals, but through that which joins</p>
<p>Four circles with the threefold cross, in best</p>
<p>Course, and in happiest constellation set</p>
<p>He comes, and to the worldly wax best gives</p>
<p>Its temper and impression. Morning there,</p>
<p>Here eve was by almost such passage made;</p>
<p>And whiteness had o&rsquo;erspread that hemisphere,</p>
<p>Blackness the other part; when to the left</p>
<p>I saw Beatrice turn&rsquo;d, and on the sun</p>
<p>Gazing, as never eagle fix&rsquo;d his ken.</p>
<p>As from the first a second beam is wont</p>
<p>To issue, and reflected upwards rise,</p>
<p>E&rsquo;en as a pilgrim bent on his return,</p>
<p>So of her act, that through the eyesight pass&rsquo;d</p>
<p>Into my fancy, mine was form&rsquo;d; and straight,</p>
<p>Beyond our mortal wont, I fix&rsquo;d mine eyes</p>
<p>Upon the sun. Much is allowed us there,</p>
<p>That here exceeds our pow&rsquo;r; thanks to the place</p>
<p>Made for the dwelling of the human kind</p>
<p class="slindent">I suffer&rsquo;d it not long, and yet so long</p>
<p>That I beheld it bick&rsquo;ring sparks around,</p>
<p>As iron that comes boiling from the fire.</p>
<p>And suddenly upon the day appear&rsquo;d</p>
<p>A day new-ris&rsquo;n, as he, who hath the power,</p>
<p>Had with another sun bedeck&rsquo;d the sky.</p>
<p class="slindent">Her eyes fast fix&rsquo;d on the eternal wheels,</p>
<p>Beatrice stood unmov&rsquo;d; and I with ken</p>
<p>Fix&rsquo;d upon her, from upward gaze remov&rsquo;d</p>
<p>At her aspect, such inwardly became</p>
<p>As Glaucus, when he tasted of the herb,</p>
<p>That made him peer among the ocean gods;</p>
<p>Words may not tell of that transhuman change:</p>
<p>And therefore let the example serve, though weak,</p>
<p>For those whom grace hath better proof in store</p>
<p class="slindent">If I were only what thou didst create,</p>
<p>Then newly, Love! by whom the heav&rsquo;n is rul&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>Thou know&rsquo;st, who by thy light didst bear me up.</p>
<p>Whenas the wheel which thou dost ever guide,</p>
<p>Desired Spirit! with its harmony</p>
<p>Temper&rsquo;d of thee and measur&rsquo;d, charm&rsquo;d mine ear,</p>
<p>Then seem&rsquo;d to me so much of heav&rsquo;n to blaze</p>
<p>With the sun&rsquo;s flame, that rain or flood ne&rsquo;er made</p>
<p>A lake so broad. The newness of the sound,</p>
<p>And that great light, inflam&rsquo;d me with desire,</p>
<p>Keener than e&rsquo;er was felt, to know their cause.</p>
<p class="slindent">Whence she who saw me, clearly as myself,</p>
<p>To calm my troubled mind, before I ask&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>Open&rsquo;d her lips, and gracious thus began:</p>
<p>&ldquo;With false imagination thou thyself</p>
<p>Mak&rsquo;st dull, so that thou seest not the thing,</p>
<p>Which thou hadst seen, had that been shaken off.</p>
<p>Thou art not on the earth as thou believ&rsquo;st;</p>
<p>For light&rsquo;ning scap&rsquo;d from its own proper place</p>
<p>Ne&rsquo;er ran, as thou hast hither now return&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Although divested of my first-rais&rsquo;d doubt,</p>
<p>By those brief words, accompanied with smiles,</p>
<p>Yet in new doubt was I entangled more,</p>
<p>And said: &ldquo;Already satisfied, I rest</p>
<p>From admiration deep, but now admire</p>
<p>How I above those lighter bodies rise.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Whence, after utt&rsquo;rance of a piteous sigh,</p>
<p>She tow&rsquo;rds me bent her eyes, with such a look,</p>
<p>As on her frenzied child a mother casts;</p>
<p>Then thus began: &ldquo;Among themselves all things</p>
<p>Have order; and from hence the form, which makes</p>
<p>The universe resemble God. In this</p>
<p>The higher creatures see the printed steps</p>
<p>Of that eternal worth, which is the end</p>
<p>Whither the line is drawn. All natures lean,</p>
<p>In this their order, diversely, some more,</p>
<p>Some less approaching to their primal source.</p>
<p>Thus they to different havens are mov&rsquo;d on</p>
<p>Through the vast sea of being, and each one</p>
<p>With instinct giv&rsquo;n, that bears it in its course;</p>
<p>This to the lunar sphere directs the fire,</p>
<p>This prompts the hearts of mortal animals,</p>
<p>This the brute earth together knits, and binds.</p>
<p>Nor only creatures, void of intellect,</p>
<p>Are aim&rsquo;d at by this bow; hut even those,</p>
<p>That have intelligence and love, are pierc&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>That Providence, who so well orders all,</p>
<p>With her own light makes ever calm the heaven,</p>
<p>In which the substance, that hath greatest speed,</p>
<p>Is turn&rsquo;d: and thither now, as to our seat</p>
<p>Predestin&rsquo;d, we are carried by the force</p>
<p>Of that strong cord, that never looses dart,</p>
<p>But at fair aim and glad. Yet is it true,</p>
<p>That as ofttimes but ill accords the form</p>
<p>To the design of art, through sluggishness</p>
<p>Of unreplying matter, so this course</p>
<p>Is sometimes quitted by the creature, who</p>
<p>Hath power, directed thus, to bend elsewhere;</p>
<p>As from a cloud the fire is seen to fall,</p>
<p>From its original impulse warp&rsquo;d, to earth,</p>
<p>By vicious fondness. Thou no more admire</p>
<p>Thy soaring, (if I rightly deem,) than lapse</p>
<p>Of torrent downwards from a mountain&rsquo;s height.</p>
<p>There would in thee for wonder be more cause,</p>
<p>If, free of hind&rsquo;rance, thou hadst fix&rsquo;d thyself</p>
<p>Below, like fire unmoving on the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">So said, she turn&rsquo;d toward the heav&rsquo;n her face.</p>
</div>`,
`<p class="cantohead">Canto II</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>All ye, who in small bark have following sail&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>Eager to listen, on the advent&rsquo;rous track</p>
<p>Of my proud keel, that singing cuts its way,</p>
<p>Backward return with speed, and your own shores</p>
<p>Revisit, nor put out to open sea,</p>
<p>Where losing me, perchance ye may remain</p>
<p>Bewilder&rsquo;d in deep maze. The way I pass</p>
<p>Ne&rsquo;er yet was run: Minerva breathes the gale,</p>
<p>Apollo guides me, and another Nine</p>
<p>To my rapt sight the arctic beams reveal.</p>
<p>Ye other few, who have outstretch&rsquo;d the neck.</p>
<p>Timely for food of angels, on which here</p>
<p>They live, yet never know satiety,</p>
<p>Through the deep brine ye fearless may put out</p>
<p>Your vessel, marking, well the furrow broad</p>
<p>Before you in the wave, that on both sides</p>
<p>Equal returns. Those, glorious, who pass&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er</p>
<p>To Colchos, wonder&rsquo;d not as ye will do,</p>
<p>When they saw Jason following the plough.</p>
<p class="slindent">The increate perpetual thirst, that draws</p>
<p>Toward the realm of God&rsquo;s own form, bore us</p>
<p>Swift almost as the heaven ye behold.</p>
<p class="slindent">Beatrice upward gaz&rsquo;d, and I on her,</p>
<p>And in such space as on the notch a dart</p>
<p>Is plac&rsquo;d, then loosen&rsquo;d flies, I saw myself</p>
<p>Arriv&rsquo;d, where wond&rsquo;rous thing engag&rsquo;d my sight.</p>
<p>Whence she, to whom no work of mine was hid,</p>
<p>Turning to me, with aspect glad as fair,</p>
<p>Bespake me: &ldquo;Gratefully direct thy mind</p>
<p>To God, through whom to this first star we come.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Me seem&rsquo;d as if a cloud had cover&rsquo;d us,</p>
<p>Translucent, solid, firm, and polish&rsquo;d bright,</p>
<p>Like adamant, which the sun&rsquo;s beam had smit</p>
<p>Within itself the ever-during pearl</p>
<p>Receiv&rsquo;d us, as the wave a ray of light</p>
<p>Receives, and rests unbroken. If I then</p>
<p>Was of corporeal frame, and it transcend</p>
<p>Our weaker thought, how one dimension thus</p>
<p>Another could endure, which needs must be</p>
<p>If body enter body, how much more</p>
<p>Must the desire inflame us to behold</p>
<p>That essence, which discovers by what means</p>
<p>God and our nature join&rsquo;d! There will be seen</p>
<p>That which we hold through faith, not shown by proof,</p>
<p>But in itself intelligibly plain,</p>
<p>E&rsquo;en as the truth that man at first believes.</p>
<p class="slindent">I answered: &ldquo;Lady! I with thoughts devout,</p>
<p>Such as I best can frame, give thanks to Him,</p>
<p>Who hath remov&rsquo;d me from the mortal world.</p>
<p>But tell, I pray thee, whence the gloomy spots</p>
<p>Upon this body, which below on earth</p>
<p>Give rise to talk of Cain in fabling quaint?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">She somewhat smil&rsquo;d, then spake: &ldquo;If mortals err</p>
<p>In their opinion, when the key of sense</p>
<p>Unlocks not, surely wonder&rsquo;s weapon keen</p>
<p>Ought not to pierce thee; since thou find&rsquo;st, the wings</p>
<p>Of reason to pursue the senses&rsquo; flight</p>
<p>Are short. But what thy own thought is, declare.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Then I: &ldquo;What various here above appears,</p>
<p>Is caus&rsquo;d, I deem, by bodies dense or rare.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">She then resum&rsquo;d: &ldquo;Thou certainly wilt see</p>
<p>In falsehood thy belief o&rsquo;erwhelm&rsquo;d, if well</p>
<p>Thou listen to the arguments, which I</p>
<p>Shall bring to face it. The eighth sphere displays</p>
<p>Numberless lights, the which in kind and size</p>
<p>May be remark&rsquo;d of different aspects;</p>
<p>If rare or dense of that were cause alone,</p>
<p>One single virtue then would be in all,</p>
<p>Alike distributed, or more, or less.</p>
<p>Different virtues needs must be the fruits</p>
<p>Of formal principles, and these, save one,</p>
<p>Will by thy reasoning be destroy&rsquo;d. Beside,</p>
<p>If rarity were of that dusk the cause,</p>
<p>Which thou inquirest, either in some part</p>
<p>That planet must throughout be void, nor fed</p>
<p>With its own matter; or, as bodies share</p>
<p>Their fat and leanness, in like manner this</p>
<p>Must in its volume change the leaves. The first,</p>
<p>If it were true, had through the sun&rsquo;s eclipse</p>
<p>Been manifested, by transparency</p>
<p>Of light, as through aught rare beside effus&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>But this is not. Therefore remains to see</p>
<p>The other cause: and if the other fall,</p>
<p>Erroneous so must prove what seem&rsquo;d to thee.</p>
<p>If not from side to side this rarity</p>
<p>Pass through, there needs must be a limit, whence</p>
<p>Its contrary no further lets it pass.</p>
<p>And hence the beam, that from without proceeds,</p>
<p>Must be pour&rsquo;d back, as colour comes, through glass</p>
<p>Reflected, which behind it lead conceals.</p>
<p>Now wilt thou say, that there of murkier hue</p>
<p>Than in the other part the ray is shown,</p>
<p>By being thence refracted farther back.</p>
<p>From this perplexity will free thee soon</p>
<p>Experience, if thereof thou trial make,</p>
<p>The fountain whence your arts derive their streame.</p>
<p>Three mirrors shalt thou take, and two remove</p>
<p>From thee alike, and more remote the third.</p>
<p>Betwixt the former pair, shall meet thine eyes;</p>
<p>Then turn&rsquo;d toward them, cause behind thy back</p>
<p>A light to stand, that on the three shall shine,</p>
<p>And thus reflected come to thee from all.</p>
<p>Though that beheld most distant do not stretch</p>
<p>A space so ample, yet in brightness thou</p>
<p>Will own it equaling the rest. But now,</p>
<p>As under snow the ground, if the warm ray</p>
<p>Smites it, remains dismantled of the hue</p>
<p>And cold, that cover&rsquo;d it before, so thee,</p>
<p>Dismantled in thy mind, I will inform</p>
<p>With light so lively, that the tremulous beam</p>
<p>Shall quiver where it falls. Within the heaven,</p>
<p>Where peace divine inhabits, circles round</p>
<p>A body, in whose virtue dies the being</p>
<p>Of all that it contains. The following heaven,</p>
<p>That hath so many lights, this being divides,</p>
<p>Through different essences, from it distinct,</p>
<p>And yet contain&rsquo;d within it. The other orbs</p>
<p>Their separate distinctions variously</p>
<p>Dispose, for their own seed and produce apt.</p>
<p>Thus do these organs of the world proceed,</p>
<p>As thou beholdest now, from step to step,</p>
<p>Their influences from above deriving,</p>
<p>And thence transmitting downwards. Mark me well,</p>
<p>How through this passage to the truth I ford,</p>
<p>The truth thou lov&rsquo;st, that thou henceforth alone,</p>
<p>May&rsquo;st know to keep the shallows, safe, untold.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;The virtue and motion of the sacred orbs,</p>
<p>As mallet by the workman&rsquo;s hand, must needs</p>
<p>By blessed movers be inspir&rsquo;d. This heaven,</p>
<p>Made beauteous by so many luminaries,</p>
<p>From the deep spirit, that moves its circling sphere,</p>
<p>Its image takes an impress as a seal:</p>
<p>And as the soul, that dwells within your dust,</p>
<p>Through members different, yet together form&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>In different pow&rsquo;rs resolves itself; e&rsquo;en so</p>
<p>The intellectual efficacy unfolds</p>
<p>Its goodness multiplied throughout the stars;</p>
<p>On its own unity revolving still.</p>
<p>Different virtue compact different</p>
<p>Makes with the precious body it enlivens,</p>
<p>With which it knits, as life in you is knit.</p>
<p>From its original nature full of joy,</p>
<p>The virtue mingled through the body shines,</p>
<p>As joy through pupil of the living eye.</p>
<p>From hence proceeds, that which from light to light</p>
<p>Seems different, and not from dense or rare.</p>
<p>This is the formal cause, that generates</p>
<p>Proportion&rsquo;d to its power, the dusk or clear.&rdquo;</p>
</div>`,
`<p class="cantohead">Canto III</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>That sun, which erst with love my bosom warm&rsquo;d</p>
<p>Had of fair truth unveil&rsquo;d the sweet aspect,</p>
<p>By proof of right, and of the false reproof;</p>
<p>And I, to own myself convinc&rsquo;d and free</p>
<p>Of doubt, as much as needed, rais&rsquo;d my head</p>
<p>Erect for speech. But soon a sight appear&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>Which, so intent to mark it, held me fix&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>That of confession I no longer thought.</p>
<p class="slindent">As through translucent and smooth glass, or wave</p>
<p>Clear and unmov&rsquo;d, and flowing not so deep</p>
<p>As that its bed is dark, the shape returns</p>
<p>So faint of our impictur&rsquo;d lineaments,</p>
<p>That on white forehead set a pearl as strong</p>
<p>Comes to the eye: such saw I many a face,</p>
<p>All stretch&rsquo;d to speak, from whence I straight conceiv&rsquo;d</p>
<p>Delusion opposite to that, which rais&rsquo;d</p>
<p>Between the man and fountain, amorous flame.</p>
<p class="slindent">Sudden, as I perceiv&rsquo;d them, deeming these</p>
<p>Reflected semblances to see of whom</p>
<p>They were, I turn&rsquo;d mine eyes, and nothing saw;</p>
<p>Then turn&rsquo;d them back, directed on the light</p>
<p>Of my sweet guide, who smiling shot forth beams</p>
<p>From her celestial eyes. &ldquo;Wonder not thou,&rdquo;</p>
<p>She cry&rsquo;d, &ldquo;at this my smiling, when I see</p>
<p>Thy childish judgment; since not yet on truth</p>
<p>It rests the foot, but, as it still is wont,</p>
<p>Makes thee fall back in unsound vacancy.</p>
<p>True substances are these, which thou behold&rsquo;st,</p>
<p>Hither through failure of their vow exil&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>But speak thou with them; listen, and believe,</p>
<p>That the true light, which fills them with desire,</p>
<p>Permits not from its beams their feet to stray.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Straight to the shadow which for converse seem&rsquo;d</p>
<p>Most earnest, I addressed me, and began,</p>
<p>As one by over-eagerness perplex&rsquo;d:</p>
<p>&ldquo;O spirit, born for joy! who in the rays</p>
<p>Of life eternal, of that sweetness know&rsquo;st</p>
<p>The flavour, which, not tasted, passes far</p>
<p>All apprehension, me it well would please,</p>
<p>If thou wouldst tell me of thy name, and this</p>
<p>Your station here.&rdquo; Whence she, with kindness prompt,</p>
<p>And eyes glist&rsquo;ning with smiles: &ldquo;Our charity,</p>
<p>To any wish by justice introduc&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>Bars not the door, no more than she above,</p>
<p>Who would have all her court be like herself.</p>
<p>I was a virgin sister in the earth;</p>
<p>And if thy mind observe me well, this form,</p>
<p>With such addition grac&rsquo;d of loveliness,</p>
<p>Will not conceal me long, but thou wilt know</p>
<p>Piccarda, in the tardiest sphere thus plac&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>Here &rsquo;mid these other blessed also blest.</p>
<p>Our hearts, whose high affections burn alone</p>
<p>With pleasure, from the Holy Spirit conceiv&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>Admitted to his order dwell in joy.</p>
<p>And this condition, which appears so low,</p>
<p>Is for this cause assign&rsquo;d us, that our vows</p>
<p>Were in some part neglected and made void.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Whence I to her replied: &ldquo;Something divine</p>
<p>Beams in your countenance, wond&rsquo;rous fair,</p>
<p>From former knowledge quite transmuting you.</p>
<p>Therefore to recollect was I so slow.</p>
<p>But what thou sayst hath to my memory</p>
<p>Given now such aid, that to retrace your forms</p>
<p>Is easier. Yet inform me, ye, who here</p>
<p>Are happy, long ye for a higher place</p>
<p>More to behold, and more in love to dwell?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">She with those other spirits gently smil&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>Then answer&rsquo;d with such gladness, that she seem&rsquo;d</p>
<p>With love&rsquo;s first flame to glow: &ldquo;Brother! our will</p>
<p>Is in composure settled by the power</p>
<p>Of charity, who makes us will alone</p>
<p>What we possess, and nought beyond desire;</p>
<p>If we should wish to be exalted more,</p>
<p>Then must our wishes jar with the high will</p>
<p>Of him, who sets us here, which in these orbs</p>
<p>Thou wilt confess not possible, if here</p>
<p>To be in charity must needs befall,</p>
<p>And if her nature well thou contemplate.</p>
<p>Rather it is inherent in this state</p>
<p>Of blessedness, to keep ourselves within</p>
<p>The divine will, by which our wills with his</p>
<p>Are one. So that as we from step to step</p>
<p>Are plac&rsquo;d throughout this kingdom, pleases all,</p>
<p>E&rsquo;en as our King, who in us plants his will;</p>
<p>And in his will is our tranquillity;</p>
<p>It is the mighty ocean, whither tends</p>
<p>Whatever it creates and nature makes.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Then saw I clearly how each spot in heav&rsquo;n</p>
<p>Is Paradise, though with like gracious dew</p>
<p>The supreme virtue show&rsquo;r not over all.</p>
<p class="slindent">But as it chances, if one sort of food</p>
<p>Hath satiated, and of another still</p>
<p>The appetite remains, that this is ask&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>And thanks for that return&rsquo;d; e&rsquo;en so did I</p>
<p>In word and motion, bent from her to learn</p>
<p>What web it was, through which she had not drawn</p>
<p>The shuttle to its point. She thus began:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exalted worth and perfectness of life</p>
<p>The Lady higher up enshrine in heaven,</p>
<p>By whose pure laws upon your nether earth</p>
<p>The robe and veil they wear, to that intent,</p>
<p>That e&rsquo;en till death they may keep watch or sleep</p>
<p>With their great bridegroom, who accepts each vow,</p>
<p>Which to his gracious pleasure love conforms.</p>
<p>from the world, to follow her, when young</p>
<p>Escap&rsquo;d; and, in her vesture mantling me,</p>
<p>Made promise of the way her sect enjoins.</p>
<p>Thereafter men, for ill than good more apt,</p>
<p>Forth snatch&rsquo;d me from the pleasant cloister&rsquo;s pale.</p>
<p>God knows how after that my life was fram&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>This other splendid shape, which thou beholdst</p>
<p>At my right side, burning with all the light</p>
<p>Of this our orb, what of myself I tell</p>
<p>May to herself apply. From her, like me</p>
<p>A sister, with like violence were torn</p>
<p>The saintly folds, that shaded her fair brows.</p>
<p>E&rsquo;en when she to the world again was brought</p>
<p>In spite of her own will and better wont,</p>
<p>Yet not for that the bosom&rsquo;s inward veil</p>
<p>Did she renounce. This is the luminary</p>
<p>Of mighty Constance, who from that loud blast,</p>
<p>Which blew the second over Suabia&rsquo;s realm,</p>
<p>That power produc&rsquo;d, which was the third and last.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">She ceas&rsquo;d from further talk, and then began</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ave Maria&rdquo; singing, and with that song</p>
<p>Vanish&rsquo;d, as heavy substance through deep wave.</p>
<p class="slindent">Mine eye, that far as it was capable,</p>
<p>Pursued her, when in dimness she was lost,</p>
<p>Turn&rsquo;d to the mark where greater want impell&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>And bent on Beatrice all its gaze.</p>

<p>Of two fierce wolves, in dread of both alike:</p>
<p>E&rsquo;en so between two deer a dog would stand,</p>
<p>Wherefore, if I was silent, fault nor praise</p>
<p>I to myself impute, by equal doubts</p>
<p>Held in suspense, since of necessity</p>
<p>It happen&rsquo;d. Silent was I, yet desire</p>
<p>Was painted in my looks; and thus I spake</p>
<p>My wish more earnestly than language could.</p>
<p class="slindent">As Daniel, when the haughty king he freed</p>
<p>From ire, that spurr&rsquo;d him on to deeds unjust</p>
<p>And violent; so look&rsquo;d Beatrice then.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Well I discern,&rdquo; she thus her words address&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>&ldquo;How contrary desires each way constrain thee,</p>
<p>So that thy anxious thought is in itself</p>
<p>Bound up and stifled, nor breathes freely forth.</p>
<p>Thou arguest; if the good intent remain;</p>
<p>What reason that another&rsquo;s violence</p>
<p>Should stint the measure of my fair desert?</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Cause too thou findst for doubt, in that it seems,</p>
<p>That spirits to the stars, as Plato deem&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>Return. These are the questions which thy will</p>
<p>Urge equally; and therefore I the first</p>
<p>Of that will treat which hath the more of gall.</p>
<p>Of seraphim he who is most ensky&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>Moses and Samuel, and either John,</p>
<p>Choose which thou wilt, nor even Mary&rsquo;s self,</p>
<p>Have not in any other heav&rsquo;n their seats,</p>
<p>Than have those spirits which so late thou saw&rsquo;st;</p>
<p>Nor more or fewer years exist; but all</p>
<p>Make the first circle beauteous, diversely</p>
<p>Partaking of sweet life, as more or less</p>
<p>Afflation of eternal bliss pervades them.</p>
<p>Here were they shown thee, not that fate assigns</p>
<p>This for their sphere, but for a sign to thee</p>
<p>Of that celestial furthest from the height.</p>
<p>Thus needs, that ye may apprehend, we speak:</p>
<p>Since from things sensible alone ye learn</p>
<p>That, which digested rightly after turns</p>
<p>To intellectual. For no other cause</p>
<p>The scripture, condescending graciously</p>
<p>To your perception, hands and feet to God</p>
<p>Attributes, nor so means: and holy church</p>
<p>Doth represent with human countenance</p>
<p>Gabriel, and Michael, and him who made</p>
<p>Tobias whole. Unlike what here thou seest,</p>
<p>The judgment of Timaeus, who affirms</p>
<p>Each soul restor&rsquo;d to its particular star,</p>
<p>Believing it to have been taken thence,</p>
<p>When nature gave it to inform her mold:</p>
<p>Since to appearance his intention is</p>
<p>E&rsquo;en what his words declare: or else to shun</p>
<p>Derision, haply thus he hath disguis&rsquo;d</p>
<p>His true opinion. If his meaning be,</p>
<p>That to the influencing of these orbs revert</p>
<p>The honour and the blame in human acts,</p>
<p>Perchance he doth not wholly miss the truth.</p>
<p>This principle, not understood aright,</p>
<p>Erewhile perverted well nigh all the world;</p>
<p>So that it fell to fabled names of Jove,</p>
<p>And Mercury, and Mars. That other doubt,</p>
<p>Which moves thee, is less harmful; for it brings</p>
<p>No peril of removing thee from me.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;That, to the eye of man, our justice seems</p>
<p>Unjust, is argument for faith, and not</p>
<p>For heretic declension. To the end</p>
<p>This truth may stand more clearly in your view,</p>
<p>I will content thee even to thy wish</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;If violence be, when that which suffers, nought</p>
<p>Consents to that which forceth, not for this</p>
<p>These spirits stood exculpate. For the will,</p>
<p>That will not, still survives unquench&rsquo;d, and doth</p>
<p>As nature doth in fire, tho&rsquo; violence</p>
<p>Wrest it a thousand times; for, if it yield</p>
<p>Or more or less, so far it follows force.</p>
<p>And thus did these, whom they had power to seek</p>
<p>The hallow&rsquo;d place again. In them, had will</p>
<p>Been perfect, such as once upon the bars</p>
<p>Held Laurence firm, or wrought in Scaevola</p>
<p>To his own hand remorseless, to the path,</p>
<p>Whence they were drawn, their steps had hasten&rsquo;d back,</p>
<p>When liberty return&rsquo;d: but in too few</p>
<p>Resolve so steadfast dwells. And by these words</p>
<p>If duly weigh&rsquo;d, that argument is void,</p>
<p>Which oft might have perplex&rsquo;d thee still. But now</p>
<p>Another question thwarts thee, which to solve</p>
<p>Might try thy patience without better aid.</p>
<p>I have, no doubt, instill&rsquo;d into thy mind,</p>
<p>That blessed spirit may not lie; since near</p>
<p>The source of primal truth it dwells for aye:</p>
<p>And thou might&rsquo;st after of Piccarda learn</p>
<p>That Constance held affection to the veil;</p>
<p>So that she seems to contradict me here.</p>
<p>Not seldom, brother, it hath chanc&rsquo;d for men</p>
<p>To do what they had gladly left undone,</p>
<p>Yet to shun peril they have done amiss:</p>
<p>E&rsquo;en as Alcmaeon, at his father&rsquo;s suit</p>
<p>Slew his own mother, so made pitiless</p>
<p>Not to lose pity. On this point bethink thee,</p>
<p>That force and will are blended in such wise</p>
<p>As not to make the&rsquo; offence excusable.</p>
<p>Absolute will agrees not to the wrong,</p>
<p>That inasmuch as there is fear of woe</p>
<p>From non-compliance, it agrees. Of will</p>
<p>Thus absolute Piccarda spake, and I</p>
<p>Of th&rsquo; other; so that both have truly said.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Such was the flow of that pure rill, that well&rsquo;d</p>
<p>From forth the fountain of all truth; and such</p>
<p>The rest, that to my wond&rsquo;ring thoughts l found.</p>
<p class="slindent"> &ldquo;O thou of primal love the prime delight!</p>

<p>Affection fails me to requite thy grace</p>
<p>With equal sum of gratitude: be his</p>
<p>To recompense, who sees and can reward thee.</p>
<p>Well I discern, that by that truth alone</p>
<p>Enlighten&rsquo;d, beyond which no truth may roam,</p>
<p>Our mind can satisfy her thirst to know:</p>
<p>Therein she resteth, e&rsquo;en as in his lair</p>
<p>The wild beast, soon as she hath reach&rsquo;d that bound,</p>
<p>And she hath power to reach it; else desire</p>
<p>Were given to no end. And thence doth doubt</p>
<p>Spring, like a shoot, around the stock of truth;</p>
<p>And it is nature which from height to height</p>
<p>On to the summit prompts us. This invites,</p>
<p>This doth assure me, lady, rev&rsquo;rently</p>
<p>To ask thee of other truth, that yet</p>
<p>Is dark to me. I fain would know, if man</p>
<p>By other works well done may so supply</p>

<p>Your love seduces, &rsquo;t is but that it shows</p>
<p>Some ill-mark&rsquo;d vestige of that primal beam.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;This would&rsquo;st thou know, if failure of the vow</p>

<p>All intellectual creatures, and them sole</p>
<p>He hath endow&rsquo;d. Hence now thou mayst infer</p>
<p>Of what high worth the vow, which so is fram&rsquo;d</p>
<p>That when man offers, God well-pleas&rsquo;d accepts;</p>
<p>For in the compact between God and him,</p>
<p>This treasure, such as I describe it to thee,</p>
<p>He makes the victim, and of his own act.</p>
<p>What compensation therefore may he find?</p>
<p>If that, whereof thou hast oblation made,</p>
<p>By using well thou think&rsquo;st to consecrate,</p>
<p>Thou would&rsquo;st of theft do charitable deed.</p>
<p>Thus I resolve thee of the greater point.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;But forasmuch as holy church, herein</p>

<p>Ere the crude aliment, which thou hast taken,</p>
<p>Digested fitly to nutrition turn.</p>
<p>Open thy mind to what I now unfold,</p>
<p>And give it inward keeping. Knowledge comes</p>
<p>Of learning well retain&rsquo;d, unfruitful else.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;This sacrifice in essence of two things</p>
<p>Consisteth; one is that, whereof &rsquo;t is made,</p>
<p>The covenant the other. For the last,</p>
<p>It ne&rsquo;er is cancell&rsquo;d if not kept: and hence</p>
<p>I spake erewhile so strictly of its force.</p>
<p>For this it was enjoin&rsquo;d the Israelites,</p>
<p>Though leave were giv&rsquo;n them, as thou know&rsquo;st, to change</p>
<p>The offering, still to offer. Th&rsquo; other part,</p>
<p>The matter and the substance of the vow,</p>
<p>May well be such, to that without offence</p>
<p>It may for other substance be exchang&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>But at his own discretion none may shift</p>
<p>The burden on his shoulders, unreleas&rsquo;d</p>
<p>By either key, the yellow and the white.</p>
<p>Nor deem of any change, as less than vain,</p>
<p>If the last bond be not within the new</p>
<p>Included, as the quatre in the six.</p>
<p>No satisfaction therefore can be paid</p>
<p>For what so precious in the balance weighs,</p>
<p>That all in counterpoise must kick the beam.</p>
<p>Take then no vow at random: ta&rsquo;en, with faith</p>
<p>Preserve it; yet not bent, as Jephthah once,</p>
<p>Blindly to execute a rash resolve,</p>
<p>Whom better it had suited to exclaim,</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have done ill,&rsquo; than to redeem his pledge</p>
<p>By doing worse or, not unlike to him</p>
<p>In folly, that great leader of the Greeks:</p>
<p>Whence, on the alter, Iphigenia mourn&rsquo;d</p>
<p>Her virgin beauty, and hath since made mourn</p>
<p>Both wise and simple, even all, who hear</p>
<p>Of so fell sacrifice. Be ye more staid,</p>
<p>O Christians, not, like feather, by each wind</p>
<p>Removable: nor think to cleanse ourselves</p>
<p>In every water. Either testament,</p>
<p>The old and new, is yours: and for your guide</p>
<p>The shepherd of the church let this suffice</p>
<p>To save you. When by evil lust entic&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>Remember ye be men, not senseless beasts;</p>
<p>Nor let the Jew, who dwelleth in your streets,</p>
<p>Hold you in mock&rsquo;ry. Be not, as the lamb,</p>
<p>That, fickle wanton, leaves its mother&rsquo;s milk,</p>
<p>To dally with itself in idle play.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Such were the words that Beatrice spake:</p>
<p>These ended, to that region, where the world</p>

<p>Her silence and chang&rsquo;d look did keep me dumb.</p>
<p>And as the arrow, ere the cord is still,</p>
<p>Leapeth unto its mark; so on we sped</p>
<p>Into the second realm. There I beheld</p>
<p>The dame, so joyous enter, that the orb</p>
<p>Grew brighter at her smiles; and, if the star</p>
<p>Were mov&rsquo;d to gladness, what then was my cheer,</p>
<p>Whom nature hath made apt for every change!</p>
<p class="slindent">As in a quiet and clear lake the fish,</p>
<p>If aught approach them from without, do draw</p>
<p>Towards it, deeming it their food; so drew</p>
<p>Full more than thousand splendours towards us,</p>
<p>And in each one was heard: &ldquo;Lo! one arriv&rsquo;d</p>
<p>To multiply our loves!&rdquo; and as each came</p>
<p>The shadow, streaming forth effulgence new,</p>
<p>Witness&rsquo;d augmented joy. Here, reader! think,</p>
<p>If thou didst miss the sequel of my tale,</p>
<p>To know the rest how sorely thou wouldst crave;</p>
<p>And thou shalt see what vehement desire</p>
<p>Possess&rsquo;d me, as soon as these had met my view,</p>
<p>To know their state. &ldquo;O born in happy hour!</p>
<p>Thou to whom grace vouchsafes, or ere thy close</p>
<p>Of fleshly warfare, to behold the thrones</p>
<p>Of that eternal triumph, know to us</p>
<p>The light communicated, which through heaven</p>
<p>Expatiates without bound. Therefore, if aught</p>
<p>Thou of our beams wouldst borrow for thine aid,</p>
<p>Spare not; and of our radiance take thy fill.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Thus of those piteous spirits one bespake me;</p>

<p>That, sparkling in thine eyes, denotes thy joy,</p>

<p>Or wherefore, worthy spirit! for thy lot</p>
<p>This sphere assign&rsquo;d, that oft from mortal ken</p>
<p>Is veil&rsquo;d by others&rsquo; beams.&rdquo; I said, and turn&rsquo;d</p>
<p>Toward the lustre, that with greeting, kind</p>
<p>Erewhile had hail&rsquo;d me. Forthwith brighter far</p>
<p>Than erst, it wax&rsquo;d: and, as himself the sun</p>
<p>Hides through excess of light, when his warm gaze</p>
<p>Hath on the mantle of thick vapours prey&rsquo;d;</p>
<p>Within its proper ray the saintly shape</p>
<p>Was, through increase of gladness, thus conceal&rsquo;d;</p>

<p>A hundred years twice told and more, his seat</p>
<p>At Europe&rsquo;s extreme point, the bird of Jove</p>

<p>There, under shadow of his sacred plumes</p>
<p>Swaying the world, till through successive hands</p>
<p>To mine he came devolv&rsquo;d. Caesar I was,</p>
<p>And am Justinian; destin&rsquo;d by the will</p>
<p>Of that prime love, whose influence I feel,</p>
<p>From vain excess to clear th&rsquo; encumber&rsquo;d laws.</p>
<p>Or ere that work engag&rsquo;d me, I did hold</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s nature merely human, with such faith</p>
<p>Contented. But the blessed Agapete,</p>
<p>Who was chief shepherd, he with warning voice</p>
<p>To the true faith recall&rsquo;d me. I believ&rsquo;d</p>

<p>Was link&rsquo;d in such conjointment, &rsquo;t was a sign</p>
<p>That I should rest. To thy first question thus</p>
<p>I shape mine answer, which were ended here,</p>

<p>Both who pretend its power and who oppose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beginning from that hour, when Pallas died</p>

<p>When from Ravenna it came forth, and leap&rsquo;d</p>
<p>The Rubicon, was of so bold a flight,</p>
<p>That tongue nor pen may follow it. Tow&rsquo;rds Spain</p>

<p>What they are, and how grievous their offending,</p>

<p>Be yours, ye Ghibellines, to veil your arts</p>

<p>And let not with his Guelphs the new-crown&rsquo;d Charles</p>
<p>Assail it, but those talons hold in dread,</p>
<p>Which from a lion of more lofty port</p>
<p>Have rent the easing. Many a time ere now</p>

<p>In sudden distance from my sight were veil&rsquo;d.</p>
<p class="slindent">Me doubt possess&rsquo;d, and &ldquo;Speak,&rdquo; it whisper&rsquo;d me,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak, speak unto thy lady, that she quench</p>
<p>Thy thirst with drops of sweetness.&rdquo; Yet blank awe,</p>
<p>Which lords it o&rsquo;er me, even at the sound</p>
<p>Of Beatrice&rsquo;s name, did bow me down</p>
<p>As one in slumber held. Not long that mood</p>
<p>Beatrice suffer&rsquo;d: she, with such a smile,</p>
<p>As might have made one blest amid the flames,</p>
<p>Beaming upon me, thus her words began:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou in thy thought art pond&rsquo;ring (as I deem,</p>
<p>And what I deem is truth how just revenge</p>
<p>Could be with justice punish&rsquo;d: from which doubt</p>
<p>I soon will free thee; so thou mark my words;</p>
<p>For they of weighty matter shall possess thee.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;That man, who was unborn, himself condemn&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>And, in himself, all, who since him have liv&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>His offspring: whence, below, the human kind</p>
<p>Lay sick in grievous error many an age;</p>
<p>Until it pleas&rsquo;d the Word of God to come</p>
<p>Amongst them down, to his own person joining</p>
<p>The nature, from its Maker far estrang&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>By the mere act of his eternal love.</p>
<p>Contemplate here the wonder I unfold.</p>
<p>The nature with its Maker thus conjoin&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>Created first was blameless, pure and good;</p>
<p>But through itself alone was driven forth</p>
<p>From Paradise, because it had eschew&rsquo;d</p>
<p>The way of truth and life, to evil turn&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>Ne&rsquo;er then was penalty so just as that</p>
<p>Inflicted by the cross, if thou regard</p>
<p>The nature in assumption doom&rsquo;d: ne&rsquo;er wrong</p>
<p>So great, in reference to him, who took</p>
<p>Such nature on him, and endur&rsquo;d the doom.</p>
<p>God therefore and the Jews one sentence pleased:</p>
<p>So different effects flow&rsquo;d from one act,</p>
<p>And heav&rsquo;n was open&rsquo;d, though the earth did quake.</p>
<p>Count it not hard henceforth, when thou dost hear</p>
<p>That a just vengeance was by righteous court</p>
<p>Justly reveng&rsquo;d. But yet I see thy mind</p>
<p>By thought on thought arising sore perplex&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>And with how vehement desire it asks</p>
<p>Solution of the maze. What I have heard,</p>
<p>Is plain, thou sayst: but wherefore God this way</p>
<p>For our redemption chose, eludes my search.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Brother! no eye of man not perfected,</p>
<p>Nor fully ripen&rsquo;d in the flame of love,</p>
<p>May fathom this decree. It is a mark,</p>
<p>In sooth, much aim&rsquo;d at, and but little kenn&rsquo;d:</p>
<p>And I will therefore show thee why such way</p>
<p>Was worthiest. The celestial love, that spume</p>
<p>All envying in its bounty, in itself</p>
<p>With such effulgence blazeth, as sends forth</p>
<p>All beauteous things eternal. What distils</p>
<p>Immediate thence, no end of being knows,</p>
<p>Bearing its seal immutably impress&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>Whatever thence immediate falls, is free,</p>
<p>Free wholly, uncontrollable by power</p>
<p>Of each thing new: by such conformity</p>
<p>More grateful to its author, whose bright beams,</p>
<p>Though all partake their shining, yet in those</p>
<p>Are liveliest, which resemble him the most.</p>
<p>These tokens of pre-eminence on man</p>
<p>Largely bestow&rsquo;d, if any of them fail,</p>
<p>He needs must forfeit his nobility,</p>
<p>No longer stainless. Sin alone is that,</p>
<p>Which doth disfranchise him, and make unlike</p>
<p>To the chief good; for that its light in him</p>
<p>Is darken&rsquo;d. And to dignity thus lost</p>
<p>Is no return; unless, where guilt makes void,</p>
<p>He for ill pleasure pay with equal pain.</p>
<p>Your nature, which entirely in its seed</p>
<p>Trangress&rsquo;d, from these distinctions fell, no less</p>
<p>Than from its state in Paradise; nor means</p>
<p>Found of recovery (search all methods out</p>
<p>As strickly as thou may) save one of these,</p>
<p>The only fords were left through which to wade,</p>
<p>Either that God had of his courtesy</p>
<p>Releas&rsquo;d him merely, or else man himself</p>
<p>For his own folly by himself aton&rsquo;d.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Fix now thine eye, intently as thou canst,</p>
<p>On th&rsquo; everlasting counsel, and explore,</p>
<p>Instructed by my words, the dread abyss.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Man in himself had ever lack&rsquo;d the means</p>
<p>Of satisfaction, for he could not stoop</p>
<p>Obeying, in humility so low,</p>
<p>As high he, disobeying, thought to soar:</p>
<p>And for this reason he had vainly tried</p>
<p>Out of his own sufficiency to pay</p>
<p>The rigid satisfaction. Then behooved</p>
<p>That God should by his own ways lead him back</p>
<p>Unto the life, from whence he fell, restor&rsquo;d:</p>
<p>By both his ways, I mean, or one alone.</p>
<p>But since the deed is ever priz&rsquo;d the more,</p>
<p>The more the doer&rsquo;s good intent appears,</p>
<p>Goodness celestial, whose broad signature</p>
<p>Is on the universe, of all its ways</p>
<p>To raise ye up, was fain to leave out none,</p>
<p>Nor aught so vast or so magnificent,</p>
<p>Either for him who gave or who receiv&rsquo;d</p>
<p>Between the last night and the primal day,</p>
<p>Was or can be. For God more bounty show&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>Giving himself to make man capable</p>
<p>Of his return to life, than had the terms</p>
<p>Been mere and unconditional release.</p>
<p>And for his justice, every method else</p>
<p>Were all too scant, had not the Son of God</p>
<p>Humbled himself to put on mortal flesh.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Now, to fulfil each wish of thine, remains</p>
<p>I somewhat further to thy view unfold.</p>
<p>That thou mayst see as clearly as myself.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;I see, thou sayst, the air, the fire I see,</p>
<p>The earth and water, and all things of them</p>
<p>Compounded, to corruption turn, and soon</p>
<p>Dissolve. Yet these were also things create,</p>
<p>Because, if what were told me, had been true</p>
<p>They from corruption had been therefore free.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;The angels, O my brother! and this clime</p>
<p>Wherein thou art, impassible and pure,</p>
<p>I call created, as indeed they are</p>
<p>In their whole being. But the elements,</p>
<p>Which thou hast nam&rsquo;d, and what of them is made,</p>
<p>Are by created virtue&rsquo; inform&rsquo;d: create</p>
<p>Their substance, and create the&rsquo; informing virtue</p>
<p>In these bright stars, that round them circling move</p>
<p>The soul of every brute and of each plant,</p>
<p>The ray and motion of the sacred lights,</p>
<p>With complex potency attract and turn.</p>
<p>But this our life the&rsquo; eternal good inspires</p>
<p>Immediate, and enamours of itself;</p>
<p>So that our wishes rest for ever here.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;And hence thou mayst by inference conclude</p>
<p>Our resurrection certain, if thy mind</p>

`<p class="cantohead">Canto VIII</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>The world was in its day of peril dark</p>
<p>Wont to believe the dotage of fond love</p>
<p>From the fair Cyprian deity, who rolls</p>
<p>In her third epicycle, shed on men</p>
<p>By stream of potent radiance: therefore they</p>
<p>Of elder time, in their old error blind,</p>
<p>Not her alone with sacrifice ador&rsquo;d</p>
<p>And invocation, but like honours paid</p>
<p>To Cupid and Dione, deem&rsquo;d of them</p>
<p>Her mother, and her son, him whom they feign&rsquo;d</p>
<p>To sit in Dido&rsquo;s bosom: and from her,</p>
<p>Whom I have sung preluding, borrow&rsquo;d they</p>
<p>The appellation of that star, which views,</p>
<p>Now obvious and now averse, the sun.</p>
<p class="slindent">I was not ware that I was wafted up</p>
<p>Into its orb; but the new loveliness</p>
<p>That grac&rsquo;d my lady, gave me ample proof</p>
<p>That we had entered there. And as in flame</p>
<p>A sparkle is distinct, or voice in voice</p>
<p>Discern&rsquo;d, when one its even tenour keeps,</p>
<p>The other comes and goes; so in that light</p>
<p>I other luminaries saw, that cours&rsquo;d</p>
<p>In circling motion. rapid more or less,</p>
<p>As their eternal phases each impels.</p>
<p class="slindent">Never was blast from vapour charged with cold,</p>
<p>Whether invisible to eye or no,</p>
<p>Descended with such speed, it had not seem&rsquo;d</p>
<p>To linger in dull tardiness, compar&rsquo;d</p>
<p>To those celestial lights, that tow&rsquo;rds us came,</p>
<p>Leaving the circuit of their joyous ring,</p>
<p>Conducted by the lofty seraphim.</p>
<p>And after them, who in the van appear&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>Such an hosanna sounded, as hath left</p>
<p>Desire, ne&rsquo;er since extinct in me, to hear</p>
<p>Renew&rsquo;d the strain. Then parting from the rest</p>
<p>One near us drew, and sole began: &ldquo;We all</p>
<p>Are ready at thy pleasure, well dispos&rsquo;d</p>
<p>To do thee gentle service. We are they,</p>
<p>To whom thou in the world erewhile didst Sing</p>
<p>&lsquo;O ye! whose intellectual ministry</p>
<p>Moves the third heaven!&rsquo; and in one orb we roll,</p>
<p>One motion, one impulse, with those who rule</p>
<p>Princedoms in heaven; yet are of love so full,</p>
<p>That to please thee &rsquo;t will be as sweet to rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">After mine eyes had with meek reverence</p>
<p>Sought the celestial guide, and were by her</p>
<p>Assur&rsquo;d, they turn&rsquo;d again unto the light</p>
<p>Who had so largely promis&rsquo;d, and with voice</p>
<p>That bare the lively pressure of my zeal,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell who ye are,&rdquo; I cried. Forthwith it grew</p>
<p>In size and splendour, through augmented joy;</p>
<p>And thus it answer&rsquo;d: &ldquo;A short date below</p>
<p>The world possess&rsquo;d me. Had the time been more,</p>
<p>Much evil, that will come, had never chanc&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>My gladness hides thee from me, which doth shine .</p>
<p>Around, and shroud me, as an animal</p>
<p>In its own silk enswath&rsquo;d. Thou lov&rsquo;dst me well,</p>
<p>And had&rsquo;st good cause; for had my sojourning</p>
<p>Been longer on the earth, the love I bare thee</p>
<p>Had put forth more than blossoms. The left bank,</p>
<p>That Rhone, when he hath mix&rsquo;d with Sorga, laves.</p>
<p>In me its lord expected, and that horn</p>
<p>Of fair Ausonia, with its boroughs old,</p>
<p>Bari, and Croton, and Gaeta pil&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>From where the Trento disembogues his waves,</p>
<p>With Verde mingled, to the salt sea-flood.</p>
<p>Already on my temples beam&rsquo;d the crown,</p>
<p>Which gave me sov&rsquo;reignty over the land</p>
<p>By Danube wash&rsquo;d, whenas he strays beyond</p>
<p>The limits of his German shores. The realm,</p>
<p>Where, on the gulf by stormy Eurus lash&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>Betwixt Pelorus and Pachynian heights,</p>
<p>The beautiful Trinacria lies in gloom</p>
<p>(Not through Typhaeus, but the vap&rsquo;ry cloud</p>
<p>Bituminous upsteam&rsquo;d), THAT too did look</p>
<p>To have its scepter wielded by a race</p>
<p>Of monarchs, sprung through me from Charles and Rodolph;</p>
<p>had not ill lording which doth spirit up</p>
<p>The people ever, in Palermo rais&rsquo;d</p>
<p>The shout of &lsquo;death,&rsquo; re-echo&rsquo;d loud and long.</p>
<p>Had but my brother&rsquo;s foresight kenn&rsquo;d as much,</p>
<p>He had been warier that the greedy want</p>
<p>Of Catalonia might not work his bale.</p>
<p>And truly need there is, that he forecast,</p>
<p>Or other for him, lest more freight be laid</p>
<p>On his already over-laden bark.</p>
<p>Nature in him, from bounty fall&rsquo;n to thrift,</p>
<p>Would ask the guard of braver arms, than such</p>
<p>As only care to have their coffers fill&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;My liege, it doth enhance the joy thy words</p>
<p>Infuse into me, mighty as it is,</p>
<p>To think my gladness manifest to thee,</p>
<p>As to myself, who own it, when thou lookst</p>
<p>Into the source and limit of all good,</p>
<p>There, where thou markest that which thou dost speak,</p>
<p>Thence priz&rsquo;d of me the more. Glad thou hast made me.</p>
<p>Now make intelligent, clearing the doubt</p>
<p>Thy speech hath raised in me; for much I muse,</p>
<p>How bitter can spring up, when sweet is sown.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">I thus inquiring; he forthwith replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I have power to show one truth, soon that</p>
<p>Shall face thee, which thy questioning declares</p>
<p>Behind thee now conceal&rsquo;d. The Good, that guides</p>
<p>And blessed makes this realm, which thou dost mount,</p>
<p>Ordains its providence to be the virtue</p>
<p>In these great bodies: nor th&rsquo; all perfect Mind</p>
<p>Upholds their nature merely, but in them</p>
<p>Their energy to save: for nought, that lies</p>
<p>Within the range of that unerring bow,</p>
<p>But is as level with the destin&rsquo;d aim,</p>
<p>As ever mark to arrow&rsquo;s point oppos&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>Were it not thus, these heavens, thou dost visit,</p>
<p>Would their effect so work, it would not be</p>
<p>Art, but destruction; and this may not chance,</p>
<p>If th&rsquo; intellectual powers, that move these stars,</p>
<p>Fail not, or who, first faulty made them fail.</p>
<p>Wilt thou this truth more clearly evidenc&rsquo;d?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">To whom I thus: &ldquo;It is enough: no fear,</p>
<p>I see, lest nature in her part should tire.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">He straight rejoin&rsquo;d: &ldquo;Say, were it worse for man,</p>
<p>If he liv&rsquo;d not in fellowship on earth?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Yea,&rdquo; answer&rsquo;d I; &ldquo;nor here a reason needs.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;And may that be, if different estates</p>
<p>Grow not of different duties in your life?</p>
<p>Consult your teacher, and he tells you &lsquo;no.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Thus did he come, deducing to this point,</p>
<p>And then concluded: &ldquo;For this cause behooves,</p>
<p>The roots, from whence your operations come,</p>
<p>Must differ. Therefore one is Solon born;</p>
<p>Another, Xerxes; and Melchisidec</p>
<p>A third; and he a fourth, whose airy voyage</p>
<p>Cost him his son. In her circuitous course,</p>
<p>Nature, that is the seal to mortal wax,</p>
<p>Doth well her art, but no distinctions owns</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twixt one or other household. Hence befalls</p>
<p>That Esau is so wide of Jacob: hence</p>
<p>Quirinus of so base a father springs,</p>
<p>He dates from Mars his lineage. Were it not</p>
<p>That providence celestial overrul&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>Nature, in generation, must the path</p>
<p>Trac&rsquo;d by the generator, still pursue</p>
<p>Unswervingly. Thus place I in thy sight</p>
<p>That, which was late behind thee. But, in sign</p>
<p>Of more affection for thee, &rsquo;t is my will</p>
<p>Thou wear this corollary. Nature ever</p>
<p>Finding discordant fortune, like all seed</p>
<p>Out of its proper climate, thrives but ill.</p>
<p>And were the world below content to mark</p>
<p>And work on the foundation nature lays,</p>
<p>It would not lack supply of excellence.</p>
<p>But ye perversely to religion strain</p>
<p>Him, who was born to gird on him the sword,</p>
<p>And of the fluent phrasemen make your king;</p>
<p>Therefore your steps have wander&rsquo;d from the paths.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="slindent">And now the visage of that saintly light</p>

<p>That yet was new to me, from the recess,</p>
<p>Where it before was singing, thus began,</p>
<p>As one who joys in kindness: &ldquo;In that part</p>
<p>Of the deprav&rsquo;d Italian land, which lies</p>
<p>Between Rialto, and the fountain-springs</p>
<p>Of Brenta and of Piava, there doth rise,</p>
<p>But to no lofty eminence, a hill,</p>
<p>From whence erewhile a firebrand did descend,</p>

<p>I and it sprang; my name on earth Cunizza:</p>
<p>And here I glitter, for that by its light</p>

<p>If to excel be worthy man&rsquo;s endeavour,</p>
<p>When such life may attend the first. Yet they</p>
<p>Care not for this, the crowd that now are girt</p>

<p class="slindent">She ended, and appear&rsquo;d on other thoughts</p>
<p>Intent, re-ent&rsquo;ring on the wheel she late</p>
<p>Had left. That other joyance meanwhile wax&rsquo;d</p>
<p>A thing to marvel at, in splendour glowing,</p>
<p>Like choicest ruby stricken by the sun,</p>
<p>For, in that upper clime, effulgence comes</p>
<p>Of gladness, as here laughter: and below,</p>
<p>As the mind saddens, murkier grows the shade.</p>

<p>Which doth the earth engarland, shapes its course,</p>
<p>Between discordant shores, against the sun</p>
<p>Inward so far, it makes meridian there,</p>
<p>Where was before th&rsquo; horizon. Of that vale</p>
<p>Dwelt I upon the shore, &rsquo;twixt Ebro&rsquo;s stream</p>
<p>And Macra&rsquo;s, that divides with passage brief</p>
<p>Genoan bounds from Tuscan. East and west</p>
<p>Are nearly one to Begga and my land,</p>
<p>Whose haven erst was with its own blood warm.</p>
<p>Who knew my name were wont to call me Folco:</p>
<p>And I did bear impression of this heav&rsquo;n,</p>
<p>That now bears mine: for not with fiercer flame</p>
<p>Glow&rsquo;d Belus&rsquo; daughter, injuring alike</p>
<p>Sichaeus and Creusa, than did I,</p>
<p>Long as it suited the unripen&rsquo;d down</p>

<p>That was beguiled of Demophoon;</p>
<p>Nor Jove&rsquo;s son, when the charms of Iole</p>
<p>Were shrin&rsquo;d within his heart. And yet there hides</p>
<p>No sorrowful repentance here, but mirth,</p>
<p>Not for the fault (that doth not come to mind),</p>
<p>But for the virtue, whose o&rsquo;erruling sway</p>
<p>And providence have wrought thus quaintly. Here</p>
<p>The skill is look&rsquo;d into, that fashioneth</p>
<p>With such effectual working, and the good</p>
<p>Discern&rsquo;d, accruing to this upper world</p>
<p>From that below. But fully to content</p>
<p>Thy wishes, all that in this sphere have birth,</p>
<p>Demands my further parle. Inquire thou wouldst,</p>
<p>Who of this light is denizen, that here</p>
<p>Beside me sparkles, as the sun-beam doth</p>
<p>On the clear wave. Know then, the soul of Rahab</p>
<p>Is in that gladsome harbour, to our tribe</p>
<p>United, and the foremost rank assign&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>He to that heav&rsquo;n, at which the shadow ends</p>
<p>Of your sublunar world, was taken up,</p>
<p>First, in Christ&rsquo;s triumph, of all souls redeem&rsquo;d:</p>
<p>For well behoov&rsquo;d, that, in some part of heav&rsquo;n,</p>
<p>She should remain a trophy, to declare</p>
<p>The mighty contest won with either palm;</p>
<p>For that she favour&rsquo;d first the high exploit</p>
<p>Of Joshua on the holy land, whereof</p>
<p>The Pope recks little now. Thy city, plant</p>
<p>Of him, that on his Maker turn&rsquo;d the back,</p>
<p>And of whose envying so much woe hath sprung,</p>
<p>Engenders and expands the cursed flower,</p>
<p>That hath made wander both the sheep and lambs,</p>
<p>Turning the shepherd to a wolf. For this,</p>
<p>The gospel and great teachers laid aside,</p>
<p>The decretals, as their stuft margins show,</p>
<p>Are the sole study. Pope and Cardinals,</p>
<p>Intent on these, ne&rsquo;er journey but in thought</p>
<p>To Nazareth, where Gabriel op&rsquo;d his wings.</p>

<p>As none may see and fail to&rsquo; enjoy. Raise, then,</p>
<p>O reader! to the lofty wheels, with me,</p>
<p>Thy ken directed to the point, whereat</p>
<p>One motion strikes on th&rsquo; other. There begin</p>
<p>Thy wonder of the mighty Architect,</p>
<p>Who loves his work so inwardly, his eye</p>
<p>Doth ever watch it. See, how thence oblique</p>
<p>Brancheth the circle, where the planets roll</p>
<p>To pour their wished influence on the world;</p>
<p>Whose path not bending thus, in heav&rsquo;n above</p>
<p>Much virtue would be lost, and here on earth,</p>
<p>All power well nigh extinct: or, from direct</p>
<p>Were its departure distant more or less,</p>
<p>I&rsquo; th&rsquo; universal order, great defect</p>
<p>Must, both in heav&rsquo;n and here beneath, ensue.</p>
<p class="slindent">Now rest thee, reader! on thy bench, and muse</p>
<p>Anticipative of the feast to come;</p>
<p>So shall delight make thee not feel thy toil.</p>
<p>Lo! I have set before thee, for thyself</p>
<p>Feed now: the matter I indite, henceforth</p>
<p>Demands entire my thought. Join&rsquo;d with the part,</p>
<p>Which late we told of, the great minister</p>
<p>Of nature, that upon the world imprints</p>
<p>The virtue of the heaven, and doles out</p>
<p>Time for us with his beam, went circling on</p>
<p>Along the spires, where each hour sooner comes;</p>
<p>And I was with him, weetless of ascent,</p>
<p>As one, who till arriv&rsquo;d, weets not his coming.</p>
<p class="slindent">For Beatrice, she who passeth on</p>
<p>So suddenly from good to better, time</p>
<p>Counts not the act, oh then how great must needs</p>
<p>Have been her brightness! What she was i&rsquo; th&rsquo; sun</p>
<p>(Where I had enter&rsquo;d), not through change of hue,</p>
<p>But light transparent&mdash;did I summon up</p>
<p>Genius, art, practice&mdash;I might not so speak,</p>
<p>It should be e&rsquo;er imagin&rsquo;d: yet believ&rsquo;d</p>
<p>It may be, and the sight be justly crav&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>And if our fantasy fail of such height,</p>
<p>What marvel, since no eye above the sun</p>
<p>Hath ever travel&rsquo;d? Such are they dwell here,</p>
<p>Fourth family of the Omnipotent Sire,</p>
<p>Who of his spirit and of his offspring shows;</p>
<p>And holds them still enraptur&rsquo;d with the view.</p>
<p>And thus to me Beatrice: &ldquo;Thank, oh thank,</p>
<p>The Sun of angels, him, who by his grace</p>
<p>To this perceptible hath lifted thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Never was heart in such devotion bound,</p>
<p>And with complacency so absolute</p>
<p>Dispos&rsquo;d to render up itself to God,</p>
<p>As mine was at those words: and so entire</p>
<p>The love for Him, that held me, it eclips&rsquo;d</p>
<p>Beatrice in oblivion. Naught displeas&rsquo;d</p>
<p>Was she, but smil&rsquo;d thereat so joyously,</p>
<p>That of her laughing eyes the radiance brake</p>
<p>And scatter&rsquo;d my collected mind abroad.</p>
<p class="slindent">Then saw I a bright band, in liveliness</p>
<p>Surpassing, who themselves did make the crown,</p>
<p>And us their centre: yet more sweet in voice,</p>
<p>Than in their visage beaming. Cinctur&rsquo;d thus,</p>
<p>Sometime Latona&rsquo;s daughter we behold,</p>
<p>When the impregnate air retains the thread,</p>
<p>That weaves her zone. In the celestial court,</p>
<p>Whence I return, are many jewels found,</p>
<p>So dear and beautiful, they cannot brook</p>
<p>Transporting from that realm: and of these lights</p>
<p>Such was the song. Who doth not prune his wing</p>
<p>To soar up thither, let him look from thence</p>
<p>For tidings from the dumb. When, singing thus,</p>
<p>Those burning suns that circled round us thrice,</p>
<p>As nearest stars around the fixed pole,</p>
<p>Then seem&rsquo;d they like to ladies, from the dance</p>
<p>Not ceasing, but suspense, in silent pause,</p>
<p>List&rsquo;ning, till they have caught the strain anew:</p>
<p>Suspended so they stood: and, from within,</p>
<p>Thus heard I one, who spake: &ldquo;Since with its beam</p>
<p>The grace, whence true love lighteth first his flame,</p>
<p>That after doth increase by loving, shines</p>
<p>So multiplied in thee, it leads thee up</p>
<p>Along this ladder, down whose hallow&rsquo;d steps</p>
<p>None e&rsquo;er descend, and mount them not again,</p>
<p>Who from his phial should refuse thee wine</p>
<p>To slake thy thirst, no less constrained were,</p>
<p>Than water flowing not unto the sea.</p>
<p>Thou fain wouldst hear, what plants are these, that bloom</p>
<p>In the bright garland, which, admiring, girds</p>
<p>This fair dame round, who strengthens thee for heav&rsquo;n.</p>
<p>I then was of the lambs, that Dominic</p>
<p>Leads, for his saintly flock, along the way,</p>
<p>Where well they thrive, not sworn with vanity.</p>
<p>He, nearest on my right hand, brother was,</p>
<p>And master to me: Albert of Cologne</p>
<p>Is this: and of Aquinum, Thomas I.</p>
<p>If thou of all the rest wouldst be assur&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>Let thine eye, waiting on the words I speak,</p>
<p>In circuit journey round the blessed wreath.</p>
<p>That next resplendence issues from the smile</p>
<p>Of Gratian, who to either forum lent</p>
<p>Such help, as favour wins in Paradise.</p>
<p>The other, nearest, who adorns our quire,</p>
<p>Was Peter, he that with the widow gave</p>
<p>To holy church his treasure. The fifth light,</p>
<p>Goodliest of all, is by such love inspired,</p>
<p>That all your world craves tidings of its doom:</p>
<p>Within, there is the lofty light, endow&rsquo;d</p>
<p>With sapience so profound, if truth be truth,</p>
<p>That with a ken of such wide amplitude</p>
<p>No second hath arisen. Next behold</p>
<p>That taper&rsquo;s radiance, to whose view was shown,</p>
<p>Clearliest, the nature and the ministry</p>
<p>Angelical, while yet in flesh it dwelt.</p>
<p>In the other little light serenely smiles</p>
<p>That pleader for the Christian temples, he</p>
<p>Who did provide Augustin of his lore.</p>
<p>Now, if thy mind&rsquo;s eye pass from light to light,</p>
<p>Upon my praises following, of the eighth</p>
<p>Thy thirst is next. The saintly soul, that shows</p>
<p>The world&rsquo;s deceitfulness, to all who hear him,</p>
<p>Is, with the sight of all the good, that is,</p>
<p>Blest there. The limbs, whence it was driven, lie</p>
<p>Down in Cieldauro, and from martyrdom</p>
<p>And exile came it here. Lo! further on,</p>
<p>Where flames the arduous Spirit of Isidore,</p>
<p>Of Bede, and Richard, more than man, erewhile,</p>
<p>In deep discernment. Lastly this, from whom</p>
<p>Thy look on me reverteth, was the beam</p>
<p>Of one, whose spirit, on high musings bent,</p>
<p>Rebuk&rsquo;d the ling&rsquo;ring tardiness of death.</p>
<p>It is the eternal light of Sigebert,</p>
<p>Who &rsquo;scap&rsquo;d not envy, when of truth he argued,</p>
<p>Reading in the straw-litter&rsquo;d street.&rdquo; Forthwith,</p>
<p>As clock, that calleth up the spouse of God</p>
<p>To win her bridegroom&rsquo;s love at matin&rsquo;s hour,</p>
<p>Each part of other fitly drawn and urg&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>Sends out a tinkling sound, of note so sweet,</p>
<p>Affection springs in well-disposed breast;</p>
<p>Thus saw I move the glorious wheel, thus heard</p>
<p>Voice answ&rsquo;ring voice, so musical and soft,</p>
<p>It can be known but where day endless shines.</p>

<p class="slindent">&ldquo;E&rsquo;en as his beam illumes me, so I look</p>
<p>Into the eternal light, and clearly mark</p>
<p>Thy thoughts, from whence they rise. Thou art in doubt,</p>

<p>To thy perception, where I told thee late</p>
<p>That &lsquo;well they thrive;&rsquo; and that &lsquo;no second such</p>
<p>Hath risen,&rsquo; which no small distinction needs.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;The providence, that governeth the world,</p>
<p>In depth of counsel by created ken</p>
<p>Unfathomable, to the end that she,</p>
<p>Who with loud cries was &rsquo;spous&rsquo;d in precious blood,</p>
<p>Might keep her footing towards her well-belov&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>Safe in herself and constant unto him,</p>
<p>Hath two ordain&rsquo;d, who should on either hand</p>
<p>In chief escort her: one seraphic all</p>
<p>In fervency; for wisdom upon earth,</p>
<p>The other splendour of cherubic light.</p>
<p>I but of one will tell: he tells of both,</p>
<p>Who one commendeth. which of them so&rsquo;er</p>
<p>Be taken: for their deeds were to one end.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Between Tupino, and the wave, that falls</p>
<p>From blest Ubaldo&rsquo;s chosen hill, there hangs</p>
<p>Rich slope of mountain high, whence heat and cold</p>
<p>Are wafted through Perugia&rsquo;s eastern gate:</p>
<p>And Norcera with Gualdo, in its rear</p>
<p>Mourn for their heavy yoke. Upon that side,</p>
<p>Where it doth break its steepness most, arose</p>
<p>A sun upon the world, as duly this</p>
<p>From Ganges doth: therefore let none, who speak</p>
<p>Of that place, say Ascesi; for its name</p>
<p>Were lamely so deliver&rsquo;d; but the East,</p>
<p>To call things rightly, be it henceforth styl&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>He was not yet much distant from his rising,</p>
<p>When his good influence &rsquo;gan to bless the earth.</p>
<p>A dame to whom none openeth pleasure&rsquo;s gate</p>
<p>More than to death, was, &rsquo;gainst his father&rsquo;s will,</p>
<p>His stripling choice: and he did make her his,</p>
<p>Before the Spiritual court, by nuptial bonds,</p>
<p>And in his father&rsquo;s sight: from day to day,</p>
<p>Then lov&rsquo;d her more devoutly. She, bereav&rsquo;d</p>
<p>Of her first husband, slighted and obscure,</p>
<p>Thousand and hundred years and more, remain&rsquo;d</p>
<p>Without a single suitor, till he came.</p>
<p>Nor aught avail&rsquo;d, that, with Amyclas, she</p>
<p>Was found unmov&rsquo;d at rumour of his voice,</p>
<p>Who shook the world: nor aught her constant boldness</p>
<p>Whereby with Christ she mounted on the cross,</p>
<p>When Mary stay&rsquo;d beneath. But not to deal</p>
<p>Thus closely with thee longer, take at large</p>
<p>The rovers&rsquo; titles&mdash;Poverty and Francis.</p>
<p>Their concord and glad looks, wonder and love,</p>
<p>And sweet regard gave birth to holy thoughts,</p>
<p>So much, that venerable Bernard first</p>
<p>Did bare his feet, and, in pursuit of peace</p>
<p>So heavenly, ran, yet deem&rsquo;d his footing slow.</p>
<p>O hidden riches! O prolific good!</p>
<p>Egidius bares him next, and next Sylvester,</p>
<p>And follow both the bridegroom; so the bride</p>
<p>Can please them. Thenceforth goes he on his way,</p>
<p>The father and the master, with his spouse,</p>
<p>And with that family, whom now the cord</p>
<p>Girt humbly: nor did abjectness of heart</p>
<p>Weigh down his eyelids, for that he was son</p>
<p>Of Pietro Bernardone, and by men</p>
<p>In wond&rsquo;rous sort despis&rsquo;d. But royally</p>
<p>His hard intention he to Innocent</p>
<p>Set forth, and from him first receiv&rsquo;d the seal</p>
<p>On his religion. Then, when numerous flock&rsquo;d</p>
<p>The tribe of lowly ones, that trac&rsquo;d HIS steps,</p>
<p>Whose marvellous life deservedly were sung</p>
<p>In heights empyreal, through Honorius&rsquo; hand</p>
<p>A second crown, to deck their Guardian&rsquo;s virtues,</p>
<p>Was by the eternal Spirit inwreath&rsquo;d: and when</p>
<p>He had, through thirst of martyrdom, stood up</p>
<p>In the proud Soldan&rsquo;s presence, and there preach&rsquo;d</p>
<p>Christ and his followers; but found the race</p>
<p>Unripen&rsquo;d for conversion: back once more</p>
<p>He hasted (not to intermit his toil),</p>
<p>And reap&rsquo;d Ausonian lands. On the hard rock,</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twixt Arno and the Tyber, he from Christ</p>
<p>Took the last Signet, which his limbs two years</p>
<p>Did carry. Then the season come, that he,</p>
<p>Who to such good had destin&rsquo;d him, was pleas&rsquo;d</p>
<p>T&rsquo; advance him to the meed, which he had earn&rsquo;d</p>
<p>By his self-humbling, to his brotherhood,</p>
<p>As their just heritage, he gave in charge</p>
<p>His dearest lady, and enjoin&rsquo;d their love</p>
<p>And faith to her: and, from her bosom, will&rsquo;d</p>
<p>His goodly spirit should move forth, returning</p>
<p>To its appointed kingdom, nor would have</p>
<p>His body laid upon another bier.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Think now of one, who were a fit colleague,</p>
<p>To keep the bark of Peter in deep sea</p>
<p>Helm&rsquo;d to right point; and such our Patriarch was.</p>
<p>Therefore who follow him, as he enjoins,</p>
<p>Thou mayst be certain, take good lading in.</p>
<p>But hunger of new viands tempts his flock,</p>
<p>So that they needs into strange pastures wide</p>
<p>Must spread them: and the more remote from him</p>
<p>The stragglers wander, so much mole they come</p>
<p>Home to the sheep-fold, destitute of milk.</p>
<p>There are of them, in truth, who fear their harm,</p>
<p>And to the shepherd cleave; but these so few,</p>
<p>A little stuff may furnish out their cloaks.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Now, if my words be clear, if thou have ta&rsquo;en</p>

<p>And to his enemies terrible. So replete</p>
<p>His soul with lively virtue, that when first</p>
<p>Created, even in the mother&rsquo;s womb,</p>
<p>It prophesied. When, at the sacred font,</p>

<p>Fast-knit to Christ; and the first love he show&rsquo;d,</p>

<p>Such was the image glanc&rsquo;d into my mind,</p>
<p>As the great spirit of Aquinum ceas&rsquo;d;</p>
<p>And Beatrice after him her words</p>
<p>Resum&rsquo;d alternate: &ldquo;Need there is (tho&rsquo; yet</p>

<p>Eternally, as now: and, if it doth,</p>
<p>How, when ye shall regain your visible forms,</p>
<p>The sight may without harm endure the change,</p>
<p>That also tell.&rdquo; As those, who in a ring</p>
<p>Tread the light measure, in their fitful mirth</p>
<p>Raise loud the voice, and spring with gladder bound;</p>
<p>Thus, at the hearing of that pious suit,</p>
<p>The saintly circles in their tourneying</p>
<p>And wond&rsquo;rous note attested new delight.</p>
<p class="slindent">Whoso laments, that we must doff this garb</p>
<p>Of frail mortality, thenceforth to live</p>
<p>Immortally above, he hath not seen</p>
<p>The sweet refreshing, of that heav&rsquo;nly shower.</p>
<p class="slindent">Him, who lives ever, and for ever reigns</p>
<p>In mystic union of the Three in One,</p>
<p>Unbounded, bounding all, each spirit thrice</p>
<p>Sang, with such melody, as but to hear</p>
<p>For highest merit were an ample meed.</p>
<p>And from the lesser orb the goodliest light,</p>
<p>With gentle voice and mild, such as perhaps</p>
<p>The angel&rsquo;s once to Mary, thus replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long as the joy of Paradise shall last,</p>
<p>Our love shall shine around that raiment, bright,</p>
<p>As fervent; fervent, as in vision blest;</p>
<p>And that as far in blessedness exceeding,</p>
<p>As it hath grave beyond its virtue great.</p>
<p>Our shape, regarmented with glorious weeds</p>
<p>Of saintly flesh, must, being thus entire,</p>
<p>Show yet more gracious. Therefore shall increase,</p>
<p>Whate&rsquo;er of light, gratuitous, imparts</p>
<p>The Supreme Good; light, ministering aid,</p>
<p>The better disclose his glory: whence</p>
<p>The vision needs increasing, much increase</p>
<p>The fervour, which it kindles; and that too</p>
<p>The ray, that comes from it. But as the greed</p>
<p>Which gives out flame, yet it its whiteness shines</p>
<p>More lively than that, and so preserves</p>
<p>Its proper semblance; thus this circling sphere</p>
<p>Of splendour, shall to view less radiant seem,</p>
<p>Than shall our fleshly robe, which yonder earth</p>
<p>Now covers. Nor will such excess of light</p>
<p>O&rsquo;erpower us, in corporeal organs made</p>
<p>Firm, and susceptible of all delight.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">So ready and so cordial an &ldquo;Amen,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Followed from either choir, as plainly spoke</p>
<p>Desire of their dead bodies; yet perchance</p>
<p>Not for themselves, but for their kindred dear,</p>
<p>Mothers and sires, and those whom best they lov&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>Ere they were made imperishable flame.</p>
<p class="slindent">And lo! forthwith there rose up round about</p>
<p>A lustre over that already there,</p>
<p>Of equal clearness, like the brightening up</p>
<p>Of the horizon. As at an evening hour</p>
<p>Of twilight, new appearances through heav&rsquo;n</p>
<p>Peer with faint glimmer, doubtfully descried;</p>
<p>So there new substances, methought began</p>
<p>To rise in view; and round the other twain</p>
<p>Enwheeling, sweep their ampler circuit wide.</p>
<p class="slindent">O gentle glitter of eternal beam!</p>
<p>With what a such whiteness did it flow,</p>
<p>O&rsquo;erpowering vision in me! But so fair,</p>
<p>So passing lovely, Beatrice show&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>Mind cannot follow it, nor words express</p>
<p>Her infinite sweetness. Thence mine eyes regain&rsquo;d</p>
<p>Power to look up, and I beheld myself,</p>
<p>Sole with my lady, to more lofty bliss</p>
<p>Translated: for the star, with warmer smile</p>
<p>Impurpled, well denoted our ascent.</p>
<p class="slindent">With all the heart, and with that tongue which speaks</p>
<p>The same in all, an holocaust I made</p>
<p>To God, befitting the new grace vouchsaf&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>And from my bosom had not yet upsteam&rsquo;d</p>
<p>The fuming of that incense, when I knew</p>
<p>The rite accepted. With such mighty sheen</p>
<p>And mantling crimson, in two listed rays</p>
<p>The splendours shot before me, that I cried,</p>
<p>&ldquo;God of Sabaoth! that does prank them thus!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">As leads the galaxy from pole to pole,</p>
<p>Distinguish&rsquo;d into greater lights and less,</p>
<p>Its pathway, which the wisest fail to spell;</p>
<p>So thickly studded, in the depth of Mars,</p>
<p>Those rays describ&rsquo;d the venerable sign,</p>
<p>That quadrants in the round conjoining frame.</p>
<p>Here memory mocks the toil of genius. Christ</p>
<p>Beam&rsquo;d on that cross; and pattern fails me now.</p>
<p>But whoso takes his cross, and follows Christ</p>
<p>Will pardon me for that I leave untold,</p>
<p>When in the flecker&rsquo;d dawning he shall spy</p>
<p>The glitterance of Christ. From horn to horn,</p>
<p>And &rsquo;tween the summit and the base did move</p>
<p>Lights, scintillating, as they met and pass&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>Thus oft are seen, with ever-changeful glance,</p>
<p>Straight or athwart, now rapid and now slow,</p>
<p>The atomies of bodies, long or short,</p>
<p>To move along the sunbeam, whose slant line</p>
<p>Checkers the shadow, interpos&rsquo;d by art</p>
<p>Against the noontide heat. And as the chime</p>
<p>Of minstrel music, dulcimer, and help</p>
<p>With many strings, a pleasant dining makes</p>
<p>To him, who heareth not distinct the note;</p>
<p>So from the lights, which there appear&rsquo;d to me,</p>
<p>Gather&rsquo;d along the cross a melody,</p>
<p>That, indistinctly heard, with ravishment</p>
<p>Possess&rsquo;d me. Yet I mark&rsquo;d it was a hymn</p>
<p>Of lofty praises; for there came to me</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arise and conquer,&rdquo; as to one who hears</p>
<p>And comprehends not. Me such ecstasy</p>
<p>O&rsquo;ercame, that never till that hour was thing</p>
<p>That held me in so sweet imprisonment.</p>
<p class="slindent">Perhaps my saying over bold appears,</p>
<p>Accounting less the pleasure of those eyes,</p>
<p>Whereon to look fulfilleth all desire.</p>
<p>But he, who is aware those living seals</p>
<p>Of every beauty work with quicker force,</p>
<p>The higher they are ris&rsquo;n; and that there</p>
<p>I had not turn&rsquo;d me to them; he may well</p>
<p>Excuse me that, whereof in my excuse</p>
<p>I do accuse me, and may own my truth;</p>

<p>O most exceeding grace divine! to whom,</p>
<p>As now to thee, hath twice the heav&rsquo;nly gate</p>

<p>Was lighted such a smile, I thought that mine</p>
<p>Had div&rsquo;d unto the bottom of my grace</p>
<p>And of my bliss in Paradise. Forthwith</p>
<p>To hearing and to sight grateful alike,</p>
<p>The spirit to his proem added things</p>
<p>I understood not, so profound he spake;</p>
<p>Yet not of choice but through necessity</p>
<p>Mysterious; for his high conception scar&rsquo;d</p>
<p>Beyond the mark of mortals. When the flight</p>
<p>Of holy transport had so spent its rage,</p>
<p>That nearer to the level of our thought</p>
<p>The speech descended, the first sounds I heard</p>
<p>Were, &ldquo;Best he thou, Triunal Deity!</p>

<p>Of its own lion. They, of whom I sprang,</p>
<p>And I, had there our birth-place, where the last</p>
<p>Partition of our city first is reach&rsquo;d</p>
<p>By him, that runs her annual game. Thus much</p>
<p>Suffice of my forefathers: who they were,</p>
<p>And whence they hither came, more honourable</p>
<p>It is to pass in silence than to tell.</p>
<p>All those, who in that time were there from Mars</p>
<p>Until the Baptist, fit to carry arms,</p>
<p>Were but the fifth of them this day alive.</p>
<p>But then the citizen&rsquo;s blood, that now is mix&rsquo;d</p>
<p>From Campi and Certaldo and Fighine,</p>
<p>Ran purely through the last mechanic&rsquo;s veins.</p>
<p>O how much better were it, that these people</p>
<p>Were neighbours to you, and that at Galluzzo</p>
<p>And at Trespiano, ye should have your bound&rsquo;ry,</p>
<p>Than to have them within, and bear the stench</p>
<p>Of Aguglione&rsquo;s hind, and Signa&rsquo;s, him,</p>
<p>That hath his eye already keen for bart&rsquo;ring!</p>
<p>Had not the people, which of all the world</p>
<p>Degenerates most, been stepdame unto Caesar,</p>
<p>But, as a mother, gracious to her son;</p>
<p>Such one, as hath become a Florentine,</p>
<p>And trades and traffics, had been turn&rsquo;d adrift</p>
<p>To Simifonte, where his grandsire ply&rsquo;d</p>
<p>The beggar&rsquo;s craft. The Conti were possess&rsquo;d</p>
<p>Of Montemurlo still: the Cerchi still</p>
<p>Were in Acone&rsquo;s parish; nor had haply</p>
<p>From Valdigrieve past the Buondelmonte.</p>
<p>The city&rsquo;s malady hath ever source</p>
<p>In the confusion of its persons, as</p>
<p>The body&rsquo;s, in variety of food:</p>
<p>And the blind bull falls with a steeper plunge,</p>
<p>Than the blind lamb; and oftentimes one sword</p>
<p>Doth more and better execution,</p>
<p>Than five. Mark Luni, Urbisaglia mark,</p>
<p>How they are gone, and after them how go</p>
<p>Chiusi and Sinigaglia; and &rsquo;t will seem</p>
<p>No longer new or strange to thee to hear,</p>
<p>That families fail, when cities have their end.</p>
<p>All things, that appertain t&rsquo; ye, like yourselves,</p>
<p>Are mortal: but mortality in some</p>
<p>Ye mark not, they endure so long, and you</p>
<p>Pass by so suddenly. And as the moon</p>
<p>Doth, by the rolling of her heav&rsquo;nly sphere,</p>
<p>Hide and reveal the strand unceasingly;</p>
<p>So fortune deals with Florence. Hence admire not</p>
<p>At what of them I tell thee, whose renown</p>
<p>Time covers, the first Florentines. I saw</p>
<p>The Ughi, Catilini and Filippi,</p>
<p>The Alberichi, Greci and Ormanni,</p>
<p>Now in their wane, illustrious citizens:</p>
<p>And great as ancient, of Sannella him,</p>
<p>With him of Arca saw, and Soldanieri</p>
<p>And Ardinghi, and Bostichi. At the poop,</p>
<p>That now is laden with new felony,</p>
<p>So cumb&rsquo;rous it may speedily sink the bark,</p>
<p>The Ravignani sat, of whom is sprung</p>
<p>The County Guido, and whoso hath since</p>
<p>His title from the fam&rsquo;d Bellincione ta&rsquo;en.</p>
<p>Fair governance was yet an art well priz&rsquo;d</p>
<p>By him of Pressa: Galigaio show&rsquo;d</p>
<p>The gilded hilt and pommel, in his house.</p>
<p>The column, cloth&rsquo;d with verrey, still was seen</p>
<p>Unshaken: the Sacchetti still were great,</p>
<p>Giouchi, Sifanti, Galli and Barucci,</p>
<p>With them who blush to hear the bushel nam&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>Of the Calfucci still the branchy trunk</p>
<p>Was in its strength: and to the curule chairs</p>
<p>Sizii and Arigucci yet were drawn.</p>
<p>How mighty them I saw, whom since their pride</p>
<p>Hath undone! and in all her goodly deeds</p>
<p>Florence was by the bullets of bright gold</p>
<p>O&rsquo;erflourish&rsquo;d. Such the sires of those, who now,</p>
<p>As surely as your church is vacant, flock</p>
<p>Into her consistory, and at leisure</p>
<p>There stall them and grow fat. The o&rsquo;erweening brood,</p>
<p>That plays the dragon after him that flees,</p>
<p>But unto such, as turn and show the tooth,</p>
<p>Ay or the purse, is gentle as a lamb,</p>
<p>Was on its rise, but yet so slight esteem&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>That Ubertino of Donati grudg&rsquo;d</p>
<p>His father-in-law should yoke him to its tribe.</p>
<p>Already Caponsacco had descended</p>
<p>Into the mart from Fesole: and Giuda</p>
<p>And Infangato were good citizens.</p>
<p>A thing incredible I tell, tho&rsquo; true:</p>
<p>The gateway, named from those of Pera, led</p>
<p>Into the narrow circuit of your walls.</p>
<p>Each one, who bears the sightly quarterings</p>
<p>Of the great Baron (he whose name and worth</p>
<p>The festival of Thomas still revives)</p>
<p>His knighthood and his privilege retain&rsquo;d;</p>
<p>Albeit one, who borders them With gold,</p>
<p>This day is mingled with the common herd.</p>
<p>In Borgo yet the Gualterotti dwelt,</p>
<p>And Importuni: well for its repose</p>
<p>Had it still lack&rsquo;d of newer neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The house, from whence your tears have had their spring,</p>
<p>Through the just anger that hath murder&rsquo;d ye</p>
<p>And put a period to your gladsome days,</p>
<p>Was honour&rsquo;d, it, and those consorted with it.</p>
<p>O Buondelmonte! what ill counseling</p>
<p>Prevail&rsquo;d on thee to break the plighted bond</p>
<p>Many, who now are weeping, would rejoice,</p>
<p>Had God to Ema giv&rsquo;n thee, the first time</p>
<p>Thou near our city cam&rsquo;st. But so was doom&rsquo;d:</p>
<p>On that maim&rsquo;d stone set up to guard the bridge,</p>
<p>At thy last peace, the victim, Florence! fell.</p>
<p>With these and others like to them, I saw</p>
<p>Florence in such assur&rsquo;d tranquility,</p>
<p>She had no cause at which to grieve: with these</p>
<p>Saw her so glorious and so just, that ne&rsquo;er</p>
<p>The lily from the lance had hung reverse,</p>
<p>Or through division been with vermeil dyed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>May to our knowledge add, but to the end,</p>
<p>That thou mayst use thyself to own thy thirst</p>
<p>And men may mingle for thee when they hear.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;O plant! from whence I spring! rever&rsquo;d and lov&rsquo;d!</p>
<p>Who soar&rsquo;st so high a pitch, thou seest as clear,</p>
<p>As earthly thought determines two obtuse</p>

<p>Dost see contingencies, ere in themselves</p>

<p>All times are present, I, the whilst I scal&rsquo;d</p>
<p>With Virgil the soul purifying mount,</p>
<p>And visited the nether world of woe,</p>
<p>Touching my future destiny have heard</p>
<p>Words grievous, though I feel me on all sides</p>
<p>Well squar&rsquo;d to fortune&rsquo;s blows. Therefore my will</p>
<p>Were satisfied to know the lot awaits me,</p>
<p>The arrow, seen beforehand, slacks its flight.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">So said I to the brightness, which erewhile</p>
<p>To me had spoken, and my will declar&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>As Beatrice will&rsquo;d, explicitly.</p>
<p>Nor with oracular response obscure,</p>
<p>Such, as or ere the Lamb of God was slain,</p>
<p>Beguil&rsquo;d the credulous nations; but, in terms</p>
<p>Precise and unambiguous lore, replied</p>
<p>The spirit of paternal love, enshrin&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>Yet in his smile apparent; and thus spake:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Contingency, unfolded not to view</p>
<p>Upon the tablet of your mortal mold,</p>
<p>Is all depictur&rsquo;d in the&rsquo; eternal sight;</p>
<p>But hence deriveth not necessity,</p>
<p>More then the tall ship, hurried down the flood,</p>
<p>Doth from the vision, that reflects the scene.</p>
<p>From thence, as to the ear sweet harmony</p>
<p>From organ comes, so comes before mine eye</p>
<p>The time prepar&rsquo;d for thee. Such as driv&rsquo;n out</p>
<p>From Athens, by his cruel stepdame&rsquo;s wiles,</p>
<p>Hippolytus departed, such must thou</p>
<p>Depart from Florence. This they wish, and this</p>
<p>Contrive, and will ere long effectuate, there,</p>
<p>Where gainful merchandize is made of Christ,</p>
<p>Throughout the livelong day. The common cry,</p>
<p>Will, as &rsquo;t is ever wont, affix the blame</p>
<p>Unto the party injur&rsquo;d: but the truth</p>
<p>Shall, in the vengeance it dispenseth, find</p>
<p>A faithful witness. Thou shall leave each thing</p>
<p>Belov&rsquo;d most dearly: this is the first shaft</p>
<p>Shot from the bow of exile. Thou shalt prove</p>
<p>How salt the savour is of other&rsquo;s bread,</p>
<p>How hard the passage to descend and climb</p>
<p>By other&rsquo;s stairs, But that shall gall thee most</p>
<p>Will he the worthless and vile company,</p>
<p>With whom thou must be thrown into these straits.</p>
<p>For all ungrateful, impious all and mad,</p>
<p>Shall turn &rsquo;gainst thee: but in a little while</p>
<p>Theirs and not thine shall be the crimson&rsquo;d brow</p>
<p>Their course shall so evince their brutishness</p>
<p>T&rsquo; have ta&rsquo;en thy stand apart shall well become thee.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;First refuge thou must find, first place of rest,</p>
<p>In the great Lombard&rsquo;s courtesy, who bears</p>
<p>Upon the ladder perch&rsquo;d the sacred bird.</p>
<p>He shall behold thee with such kind regard,</p>
<p>That &rsquo;twixt ye two, the contrary to that</p>
<p>Which falls &rsquo;twixt other men, the granting shall</p>
<p>Forerun the asking. With him shalt thou see</p>
<p>That mortal, who was at his birth impress</p>
<p>So strongly from this star, that of his deeds</p>
<p>The nations shall take note. His unripe age</p>
<p>Yet holds him from observance; for these wheels</p>
<p>Only nine years have compass him about.</p>
<p>But, ere the Gascon practice on great Harry,</p>
<p>Sparkles of virtue shall shoot forth in him,</p>
<p>In equal scorn of labours and of gold.</p>
<p>His bounty shall be spread abroad so widely,</p>
<p>As not to let the tongues e&rsquo;en of his foes</p>
<p>Be idle in its praise. Look thou to him</p>
<p>And his beneficence: for he shall cause</p>
<p>Reversal of their lot to many people,</p>
<p>Rich men and beggars interchanging fortunes.</p>
<p>And thou shalt bear this written in thy soul</p>
<p>Of him, but tell it not; &ldquo;and things he told</p>
<p>Incredible to those who witness them;</p>
<p>Then added: &ldquo;So interpret thou, my son,</p>
<p>What hath been told thee.&mdash;Lo! the ambushment</p>
<p>That a few circling seasons hide for thee!</p>
<p>Yet envy not thy neighbours: time extends</p>
<p>Thy span beyond their treason&rsquo;s chastisement.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Soon, as the saintly spirit, by his silence,</p>
<p>Had shown the web, which I had streteh&rsquo;d for him</p>
<p>Upon the warp, was woven, I began,</p>
<p>As one, who in perplexity desires</p>
<p>Counsel of other, wise, benign and friendly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father! well I mark how time spurs on</p>
<p>Toward me, ready to inflict the blow,</p>
<p>Which falls most heavily on him, who most</p>
<p>Abandoned himself. Therefore &rsquo;t is good</p>
<p>I should forecast, that driven from the place</p>
<p>Most dear to me, I may not lose myself</p>
<p>All others by my song. Down through the world</p>
<p>Of infinite mourning, and along the mount</p>
<p>From whose fair height my lady&rsquo;s eyes did lift me,</p>
<p>And after through this heav&rsquo;n from light to light,</p>
<p>Have I learnt that, which if I tell again,</p>
<p>It may with many woefully disrelish;</p>
<p>And, if I am a timid friend to truth,</p>
<p>I fear my life may perish among those,</p>
<p>To whom these days shall be of ancient date.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">The brightness, where enclos&rsquo;d the treasure smil&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>Which I had found there, first shone glisteningly,</p>
<p>Like to a golden mirror in the sun;</p>
<p>Next answer&rsquo;d: &ldquo;Conscience, dimm&rsquo;d or by its own</p>
<p>Or other&rsquo;s shame, will feel thy saying sharp.</p>
<p>Thou, notwithstanding, all deceit remov&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>See the whole vision be made manifest.</p>
<p>And let them wince who have their withers wrung.</p>
<p>What though, when tasted first, thy voice shall prove</p>
<p>Unwelcome, on digestion it will turn</p>
<p>To vital nourishment. The cry thou raisest,</p>
<p>Shall, as the wind doth, smite the proudest summits;</p>
<p>Which is of honour no light argument,</p>
<p>For this there only have been shown to thee,</p>
<p>Throughout these orbs, the mountain, and the deep,</p>
<p>Spirits, whom fame hath note of. For the mind</p>
<p>Of him, who hears, is loth to acquiesce</p>
<p>And fix its faith, unless the instance brought</p>
<p>Be palpable, and proof apparent urge.&rdquo;</p>
</div>`,
`<p class="cantohead">Canto XVIII</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>Now in his word, sole, ruminating, joy&rsquo;d</p>
<p>That blessed spirit; and I fed on mine,</p>
<p>Tempting the sweet with bitter: she meanwhile,</p>
<p>Who led me unto God, admonish&rsquo;d: &ldquo;Muse</p>
<p>On other thoughts: bethink thee, that near Him</p>
<p>I dwell, who recompenseth every wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">At the sweet sounds of comfort straight I turn&rsquo;d;</p>
<p>And, in the saintly eyes what love was seen,</p>
<p>I leave in silence here: nor through distrust</p>
<p>Of my words only, but that to such bliss</p>
<p>The mind remounts not without aid. Thus much</p>
<p>Yet may I speak; that, as I gaz&rsquo;d on her,</p>
<p>Affection found no room for other wish.</p>
<p>While the everlasting pleasure, that did full</p>
<p>On Beatrice shine, with second view</p>
<p>From her fair countenance my gladden&rsquo;d soul</p>
<p>Contented; vanquishing me with a beam</p>
<p>Of her soft smile, she spake: &ldquo;Turn thee, and list.</p>
<p>These eyes are not thy only Paradise.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">As here we sometimes in the looks may see</p>
<p>Th&rsquo; affection mark&rsquo;d, when that its sway hath ta&rsquo;en</p>
<p>The spirit wholly; thus the hallow&rsquo;d light,</p>
<p>To whom I turn&rsquo;d, flashing, bewray&rsquo;d its will</p>
<p>To talk yet further with me, and began:</p>
<p>&ldquo;On this fifth lodgment of the tree, whose life</p>
<p>Is from its top, whose fruit is ever fair</p>
<p>And leaf unwith&rsquo;ring, blessed spirits abide,</p>
<p>That were below, ere they arriv&rsquo;d in heav&rsquo;n,</p>
<p>So mighty in renown, as every muse</p>
<p>Might grace her triumph with them. On the horns</p>
<p>Look therefore of the cross: he, whom I name,</p>
<p>Shall there enact, as doth 1n summer cloud</p>
<p>Its nimble fire.&rdquo; Along the cross I saw,</p>
<p>At the repeated name of Joshua,</p>
<p>A splendour gliding; nor, the word was said,</p>
<p>Ere it was done: then, at the naming saw</p>
<p>Of the great Maccabee, another move</p>
<p>With whirling speed; and gladness was the scourge</p>
<p>Unto that top. The next for Charlemagne</p>
<p>And for the peer Orlando, two my gaze</p>
<p>Pursued, intently, as the eye pursues</p>
<p>A falcon flying. Last, along the cross,</p>
<p>William, and Renard, and Duke Godfrey drew</p>
<p>My ken, and Robert Guiscard. And the soul,</p>
<p>Who spake with me among the other lights</p>
<p>Did move away, and mix; and with the choir</p>
<p>Of heav&rsquo;nly songsters prov&rsquo;d his tuneful skill.</p>
<p class="slindent">To Beatrice on my right l bent,</p>
<p>Looking for intimation or by word</p>
<p>Or act, what next behoov&rsquo;d; and did descry</p>
<p>Such mere effulgence in her eyes, such joy,</p>
<p>It past all former wont. And, as by sense</p>
<p>Of new delight, the man, who perseveres</p>
<p>In good deeds doth perceive from day to day</p>
<p>His virtue growing; I e&rsquo;en thus perceiv&rsquo;d</p>
<p>Of my ascent, together with the heav&rsquo;n</p>
<p>The circuit widen&rsquo;d, noting the increase</p>
<p>Of beauty in that wonder. Like the change</p>
<p>In a brief moment on some maiden&rsquo;s cheek,</p>
<p>Which from its fairness doth discharge the weight</p>
<p>Of pudency, that stain&rsquo;d it; such in her,</p>
<p>And to mine eyes so sudden was the change,</p>
<p>Through silvery whiteness of that temperate star,</p>
<p>Whose sixth orb now enfolded us. I saw,</p>
<p>Within that Jovial cresset, the clear sparks</p>
<p>Of love, that reign&rsquo;d there, fashion to my view</p>
<p>Our language. And as birds, from river banks</p>
<p>Arisen, now in round, now lengthen&rsquo;d troop,</p>
<p>Array them in their flight, greeting, as seems,</p>
<p>Their new-found pastures; so, within the lights,</p>
<p>The saintly creatures flying, sang, and made</p>
<p>Now D. now I. now L. figur&rsquo;d I&rsquo; th&rsquo; air.</p>
<p>First, singing, to their notes they mov&rsquo;d, then one</p>
<p>Becoming of these signs, a little while</p>
<p>Did rest them, and were mute. O nymph divine</p>
<p>Of Pegasean race! whose souls, which thou</p>
<p>Inspir&rsquo;st, mak&rsquo;st glorious and long-liv&rsquo;d, as they</p>
<p>Cities and realms by thee! thou with thyself</p>
<p>Inform me; that I may set forth the shapes,</p>
<p>As fancy doth present them. Be thy power</p>
<p>Display&rsquo;d in this brief song. The characters,</p>
<p>Vocal and consonant, were five-fold seven.</p>
<p>In order each, as they appear&rsquo;d, I mark&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>Diligite Justitiam, the first,</p>
<p>Both verb and noun all blazon&rsquo;d; and the extreme</p>
<p>Qui judicatis terram. In the M.</p>
<p>Of the fifth word they held their station,</p>
<p>Making the star seem silver streak&rsquo;d with gold.</p>
<p>And on the summit of the M. I saw</p>
<p>Descending other lights, that rested there,</p>
<p>Singing, methinks, their bliss and primal good.</p>
<p>Then, as at shaking of a lighted brand,</p>
<p>Sparkles innumerable on all sides</p>
<p>Rise scatter&rsquo;d, source of augury to th&rsquo; unwise;</p>
<p>Thus more than thousand twinkling lustres hence</p>
<p>Seem&rsquo;d reascending, and a higher pitch</p>
<p>Some mounting, and some less; e&rsquo;en as the sun,</p>
<p>Which kindleth them, decreed. And when each one</p>
<p>Had settled in his place, the head and neck</p>
<p>Then saw I of an eagle, lively</p>
<p>Grav&rsquo;d in that streaky fire. Who painteth there,</p>
<p>Hath none to guide him; of himself he guides;</p>
<p>And every line and texture of the nest</p>
<p>Doth own from him the virtue, fashions it.</p>
<p>The other bright beatitude, that seem&rsquo;d</p>
<p>Erewhile, with lilied crowning, well content</p>
<p>To over-canopy the M. mov&rsquo;d forth,</p>
<p>Following gently the impress of the bird.</p>
<p class="slindent"> Sweet star! what glorious and thick-studded gems</p>
<p>Declar&rsquo;d to me our justice on the earth</p>
<p>To be the effluence of that heav&rsquo;n, which thou,</p>
<p>Thyself a costly jewel, dost inlay!</p>
<p>Therefore I pray the Sovran Mind, from whom</p>
<p>Thy motion and thy virtue are begun,</p>
<p>That he would look from whence the fog doth rise,</p>
<p>To vitiate thy beam: so that once more</p>
<p>He may put forth his hand &rsquo;gainst such, as drive</p>
<p>Their traffic in that sanctuary, whose walls</p>
<p>With miracles and martyrdoms were built.</p>
<p class="slindent">Ye host of heaven! whose glory I survey l</p>
<p>O beg ye grace for those, that are on earth</p>
<p>All after ill example gone astray.</p>
<p>War once had for its instrument the sword:</p>
<p>But now &rsquo;t is made, taking the bread away</p>
<p>Which the good Father locks from none. &mdash;And thou,</p>
<p>That writes but to cancel, think, that they,</p>
<p>Who for the vineyard, which thou wastest, died,</p>
<p>Peter and Paul live yet, and mark thy doings.</p>
<p>Thou hast good cause to cry, &ldquo;My heart so cleaves</p>
<p>To him, that liv&rsquo;d in solitude remote,</p>

`<p class="cantohead">Canto XIX</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>Before my sight appear&rsquo;d, with open wings,</p>
<p>The beauteous image, in fruition sweet</p>
<p>Gladdening the thronged spirits. Each did seem</p>
<p>A little ruby, whereon so intense</p>
<p>The sun-beam glow&rsquo;d that to mine eyes it came</p>
<p>In clear refraction. And that, which next</p>
<p>Befalls me to portray, voice hath not utter&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>Nor hath ink written, nor in fantasy</p>
<p>Was e&rsquo;er conceiv&rsquo;d. For I beheld and heard</p>
<p>The beak discourse; and, what intention form&rsquo;d</p>
<p>Of many, singly as of one express,</p>
<p>Beginning: &ldquo;For that I was just and piteous,</p>
<p>l am exalted to this height of glory,</p>
<p>The which no wish exceeds: and there on earth</p>
<p>Have I my memory left, e&rsquo;en by the bad</p>
<p>Commended, while they leave its course untrod.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Thus is one heat from many embers felt,</p>
<p>As in that image many were the loves,</p>

<p>Whence I address them: &ldquo;O perennial flowers</p>
<p>Of gladness everlasting! that exhale</p>
<p>In single breath your odours manifold!</p>
<p>Breathe now; and let the hunger be appeas&rsquo;d,</p>

<p>Finding no food on earth. This well I know,</p>
<p>That if there be in heav&rsquo;n a realm, that shows</p>
<p>In faithful mirror the celestial Justice,</p>
<p>Yours without veil reflects it. Ye discern</p>
<p>The heed, wherewith I do prepare myself</p>
<p>To hearken; ye the doubt that urges me</p>
<p>With such inveterate craving.&rdquo; Straight I saw,</p>
<p>Like to a falcon issuing from the hood,</p>
<p>That rears his head, and claps him with his wings,</p>
<p>His beauty and his eagerness bewraying.</p>
<p>So saw I move that stately sign, with praise</p>
<p>Of grace divine inwoven and high song</p>
<p>Of inexpressive joy. &ldquo;He,&rdquo; it began,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who turn&rsquo;d his compass on the world&rsquo;s extreme,</p>
<p>And in that space so variously hath wrought,</p>
<p>Both openly, and in secret, in such wise</p>
<p>Could not through all the universe display</p>
<p>Impression of his glory, that the Word</p>
<p>Of his omniscience should not still remain</p>
<p>In infinite excess. In proof whereof,</p>
<p>He first through pride supplanted, who was sum</p>
<p>Of each created being, waited not</p>
<p>For light celestial, and abortive fell.</p>
<p>Whence needs each lesser nature is but scant</p>
<p>Receptacle unto that Good, which knows</p>
<p>No limit, measur&rsquo;d by itself alone.</p>
<p>Therefore your sight, of th&rsquo; omnipresent Mind</p>
<p>A single beam, its origin must own</p>
<p>Surpassing far its utmost potency.</p>
<p>The ken, your world is gifted with, descends</p>
<p>In th&rsquo; everlasting Justice as low down,</p>
<p>As eye doth in the sea; which though it mark</p>
<p>The bottom from the shore, in the wide main</p>
<p>Discerns it not; and ne&rsquo;ertheless it is,</p>
<p>But hidden through its deepness. Light is none,</p>
<p>Save that which cometh from the pure serene</p>
<p>Of ne&rsquo;er disturbed ether: for the rest,</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis darkness all, or shadow of the flesh,</p>
<p>Or else its poison. Here confess reveal&rsquo;d</p>
<p>That covert, which hath hidden from thy search</p>
<p>The living justice, of the which thou mad&rsquo;st</p>
<p>Such frequent question; for thou saidst&mdash;&rsquo;A man</p>
<p>Is born on Indus&rsquo; banks, and none is there</p>
<p>Who speaks of Christ, nor who doth read nor write,</p>
<p>And all his inclinations and his acts,</p>
<p>As far as human reason sees, are good,</p>
<p>And he offendeth not in word or deed.</p>
<p>But unbaptiz&rsquo;d he dies, and void of faith.</p>
<p>Where is the justice that condemns him? where</p>
<p>His blame, if he believeth not?&rsquo;&mdash;What then,</p>
<p>And who art thou, that on the stool wouldst sit</p>
<p>To judge at distance of a thousand miles</p>
<p>With the short-sighted vision of a span?</p>
<p>To him, who subtilizes thus with me,</p>
<p>There would assuredly be room for doubt</p>
<p>Even to wonder, did not the safe word</p>
<p>Of scripture hold supreme authority.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;O animals of clay! O spirits gross I</p>
<p>The primal will, that in itself is good,</p>
<p>Hath from itself, the chief Good, ne&rsquo;er been mov&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>Justice consists in consonance with it,</p>
<p>Derivable by no created good,</p>
<p>Whose very cause depends upon its beam.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">As on her nest the stork, that turns about</p>
<p>Unto her young, whom lately she hath fed,</p>
<p>While they with upward eyes do look on her;</p>
<p>So lifted I my gaze; and bending so</p>
<p>The ever-blessed image wav&rsquo;d its wings,</p>
<p>Lab&rsquo;ring with such deep counsel. Wheeling round</p>
<p>It warbled, and did say: &ldquo;As are my notes</p>
<p>To thee, who understand&rsquo;st them not, such is</p>
<p>Th&rsquo; eternal judgment unto mortal ken.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Then still abiding in that ensign rang&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>Wherewith the Romans over-awed the world,</p>
<p>Those burning splendours of the Holy Spirit</p>
<p>Took up the strain; and thus it spake again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;None ever hath ascended to this realm,</p>
<p>Who hath not a believer been in Christ,</p>
<p>Either before or after the blest limbs</p>
<p>Were nail&rsquo;d upon the wood. But lo! of those</p>
<p>Who call &lsquo;Christ, Christ,&rsquo; there shall be many found,</p>
<p> In judgment, further off from him by far,</p>
<p>Than such, to whom his name was never known.</p>
<p>Christians like these the Ethiop shall condemn:</p>
<p>When that the two assemblages shall part;</p>
<p>One rich eternally, the other poor.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;What may the Persians say unto your kings,</p>
<p>When they shall see that volume, in the which</p>
<p>All their dispraise is written, spread to view?</p>
<p>There amidst Albert&rsquo;s works shall that be read,</p>
<p>Which will give speedy motion to the pen,</p>
<p>When Prague shall mourn her desolated realm.</p>
<p>There shall be read the woe, that he doth work</p>
<p>With his adulterate money on the Seine,</p>

<p>No less a mark than million. He, who guards</p>

<p>The world&rsquo;s enlightener vanishes, and day</p>
<p>On all sides wasteth, suddenly the sky,</p>
<p>Erewhile irradiate only with his beam,</p>
<p>Is yet again unfolded, putting forth</p>
<p>Innumerable lights wherein one shines.</p>
<p>Of such vicissitude in heaven I thought,</p>

<p>And the world&rsquo;s leaders, in the blessed beak</p>
<p>Was silent; for that all those living lights,</p>
<p>Waxing in splendour, burst forth into songs,</p>
<p>Such as from memory glide and fall away.</p>
<p class="slindent">Sweet love! that dost apparel thee in smiles,</p>
<p>How lustrous was thy semblance in those sparkles,</p>
<p>Which merely are from holy thoughts inspir&rsquo;d!</p>
<p class="slindent">After the precious and bright beaming stones,</p>
<p>That did ingem the sixth light, ceas&rsquo;d the chiming</p>
<p>Of their angelic bells; methought I heard</p>
<p>The murmuring of a river, that doth fall</p>
<p>From rock to rock transpicuous, making known</p>
<p>The richness of his spring-head: and as sound</p>
<p>Of cistern, at the fret-board, or of pipe,</p>
<p>Is, at the wind-hole, modulate and tun&rsquo;d;</p>
<p>Thus up the neck, as it were hollow, rose</p>
<p>That murmuring of the eagle, and forthwith</p>
<p>Voice there assum&rsquo;d, and thence along the beak</p>
<p>Issued in form of words, such as my heart</p>
<p>Did look for, on whose tables I inscrib&rsquo;d them.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;The part in me, that sees, and bears the sun,,</p>

<p>That figure me, those, glittering in mine eye,</p>
<p>Are chief of all the greatest. This, that shines</p>
<p>Midmost for pupil, was the same, who sang</p>
<p>The Holy Spirit&rsquo;s song, and bare about</p>
<p>The ark from town to town; now doth he know</p>
<p>The merit of his soul-impassion&rsquo;d strains</p>
<p>By their well-fitted guerdon. Of the five,</p>
<p>That make the circle of the vision, he</p>
<p>Who to the beak is nearest, comforted</p>
<p>The widow for her son: now doth he know</p>
<p>How dear he costeth not to follow Christ,</p>
<p>Both from experience of this pleasant life,</p>
<p>And of its opposite. He next, who follows</p>
<p>In the circumference, for the over arch,</p>
<p>By true repenting slack&rsquo;d the pace of death:</p>
<p>Now knoweth he, that the degrees of heav&rsquo;n</p>
<p>Alter not, when through pious prayer below</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s is made tomorrow&rsquo;s destiny.</p>
<p>The other following, with the laws and me,</p>
<p>To yield the shepherd room, pass&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er to Greece,</p>
<p>From good intent producing evil fruit:</p>
<p>Now knoweth he, how all the ill, deriv&rsquo;d</p>
<p>From his well doing, doth not helm him aught,</p>
<p>Though it have brought destruction on the world.</p>
<p>That, which thou seest in the under bow,</p>
<p>Was William, whom that land bewails, which weeps</p>
<p>For Charles and Frederick living: now he knows</p>
<p>How well is lov&rsquo;d in heav&rsquo;n the righteous king,</p>
<p>Which he betokens by his radiant seeming.</p>
<p>Who in the erring world beneath would deem,</p>
<p>That Trojan Ripheus in this round was set</p>
<p>Fifth of the saintly splendours? now he knows</p>
<p>Enough of that, which the world cannot see,</p>
<p>The grace divine, albeit e&rsquo;en his sight</p>
<p>Reach not its utmost depth.&rdquo; Like to the lark,</p>
<p>That warbling in the air expatiates long,</p>
<p>Then, trilling out his last sweet melody,</p>
<p>Drops satiate with the sweetness; such appear&rsquo;d</p>
<p>That image stampt by the&rsquo; everlasting pleasure,</p>
<p>Which fashions like itself all lovely things.</p>
<p class="slindent">I, though my doubting were as manifest,</p>
<p>As is through glass the hue that mantles it,</p>
<p>In silence waited not: for to my lips</p>
<p>&ldquo;What things are these?&rdquo; involuntary rush&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>And forc&rsquo;d a passage out: whereat I mark&rsquo;d</p>
<p>A sudden lightening and new revelry.</p>
<p>The eye was kindled: and the blessed sign</p>
<p>No more to keep me wond&rsquo;ring and suspense,</p>
<p>Replied: &ldquo;I see that thou believ&rsquo;st these things,</p>

<p>So that thy knowledge waits not on thy faith:</p>
<p>As one who knows the name of thing by rote,</p>
<p>But is a stranger to its properties,</p>
<p>Till other&rsquo;s tongue reveal them. Fervent love</p>
<p>And lively hope with violence assail</p>
<p>The kingdom of the heavens, and overcome</p>
<p>The will of the Most high; not in such sort</p>
<p>As man prevails o&rsquo;er man; but conquers it,</p>
<p>Because &rsquo;t is willing to be conquer&rsquo;d, still,</p>
<p>Though conquer&rsquo;d, by its mercy conquering.</p>

<p>Cause thee to marvel, in that thou behold&rsquo;st</p>
<p>The region of the angels deck&rsquo;d with them.</p>
<p>They quitted not their bodies, as thou deem&rsquo;st,</p>
<p>Gentiles but Christians, in firm rooted faith,</p>
<p>This of the feet in future to be pierc&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>That of feet nail&rsquo;d already to the cross.</p>
<p>One from the barrier of the dark abyss,</p>
<p>Where never any with good will returns,</p>
<p>Came back unto his bones. Of lively hope</p>
<p>Such was the meed; of lively hope, that wing&rsquo;d</p>
<p>The prayers sent up to God for his release,</p>
<p>And put power into them to bend his will.</p>
<p>The glorious Spirit, of whom I speak to thee,</p>
<p>A little while returning to the flesh,</p>
<p>Believ&rsquo;d in him, who had the means to help,</p>
<p>And, in believing, nourish&rsquo;d such a flame</p>
<p>Of holy love, that at the second death</p>
<p>He was made sharer in our gamesome mirth.</p>
<p>The other, through the riches of that grace,</p>
<p>Which from so deep a fountain doth distil,</p>
<p>As never eye created saw its rising,</p>
<p>Plac&rsquo;d all his love below on just and right:</p>
<p>Wherefore of grace God op&rsquo;d in him the eye</p>
<p>To the redemption of mankind to come;</p>
<p>Wherein believing, he endur&rsquo;d no more</p>
<p>The filth of paganism, and for their ways</p>
<p>Rebuk&rsquo;d the stubborn nations. The three nymphs,</p>
<p>Whom at the right wheel thou beheldst advancing,</p>
<p>Were sponsors for him more than thousand years</p>
<p>Before baptizing. O how far remov&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>Predestination! is thy root from such</p>
<p>As see not the First cause entire: and ye,</p>
<p>O mortal men! be wary how ye judge:</p>
<p>For we, who see our Maker, know not yet</p>
<p>The number of the chosen: and esteem</p>
<p>Such scantiness of knowledge our delight:</p>
<p>For all our good is in that primal good</p>
<p>Concentrate, and God&rsquo;s will and ours are one.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">So, by that form divine, was giv&rsquo;n to me</p>
<p>Sweet medicine to clear and strengthen sight,</p>

<p>Bids the chords vibrate, and therein the song</p>
<p>Acquires more pleasure; so, the whilst it spake,</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>Again mine eyes were fix&rsquo;d on Beatrice,</p>
<p>And with mine eyes my soul, that in her looks</p>
<p>Found all contentment. Yet no smile she wore</p>
<p>And, &ldquo;Did I smile,&rdquo; quoth she, &ldquo;thou wouldst be straight</p>
<p>Like Semele when into ashes turn&rsquo;d:</p>
<p>For, mounting these eternal palace-stairs,</p>
<p>My beauty, which the loftier it climbs,</p>
<p>As thou hast noted, still doth kindle more,</p>
<p>So shines, that, were no temp&rsquo;ring interpos&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>Thy mortal puissance would from its rays</p>
<p>Shrink, as the leaf doth from the thunderbolt.</p>
<p>Into the seventh splendour are we wafted,</p>
<p>That underneath the burning lion&rsquo;s breast</p>
<p>Beams, in this hour, commingled with his might,</p>
<p>Thy mind be with thine eyes: and in them mirror&rsquo;d</p>
<p>The shape, which in this mirror shall be shown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whoso can deem, how fondly I had fed</p>
<p>My sight upon her blissful countenance,</p>
<p>May know, when to new thoughts I chang&rsquo;d, what joy</p>
<p>To do the bidding of my heav&rsquo;nly guide:</p>
<p>In equal balance poising either weight.</p>
<p class="slindent">Within the crystal, which records the name,</p>
<p>(As its remoter circle girds the world)</p>
<p>Of that lov&rsquo;d monarch, in whose happy reign</p>
<p>No ill had power to harm, I saw rear&rsquo;d up,</p>
<p>In colour like to sun-illumin&rsquo;d gold.</p>
<p>A ladder, which my ken pursued in vain,</p>
<p>So lofty was the summit; down whose steps</p>
<p>I saw the splendours in such multitude</p>
<p>Descending, ev&rsquo;ry light in heav&rsquo;n, methought,</p>
<p>Was shed thence. As the rooks, at dawn of day</p>
<p>Bestirring them to dry their feathers chill,</p>
<p>Some speed their way a-field, and homeward some,</p>
<p>Returning, cross their flight, while some abide</p>
<p>And wheel around their airy lodge; so seem&rsquo;d</p>
<p>That glitterance, wafted on alternate wing,</p>
<p>As upon certain stair it met, and clash&rsquo;d</p>
<p>Its shining. And one ling&rsquo;ring near us, wax&rsquo;d</p>
<p>So bright, that in my thought: said: &ldquo;The love,</p>
<p>Which this betokens me, admits no doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Unwillingly from question I refrain,</p>
<p>To her, by whom my silence and my speech</p>
<p>Are order&rsquo;d, looking for a sign: whence she,</p>
<p>Who in the sight of Him, that seeth all,</p>
<p>Saw wherefore I was silent, prompted me</p>
<p>T&rsquo; indulge the fervent wish; and I began:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not worthy, of my own desert,</p>
<p>That thou shouldst answer me; but for her sake,</p>
<p>Who hath vouchsaf&rsquo;d my asking, spirit blest!</p>
<p>That in thy joy art shrouded! say the cause,</p>
<p>Which bringeth thee so near: and wherefore, say,</p>
<p>Doth the sweet symphony of Paradise</p>
<p>Keep silence here, pervading with such sounds</p>
<p>Of rapt devotion ev&rsquo;ry lower sphere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mortal art thou in hearing as in sight;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Was the reply: &ldquo;and what forbade the smile</p>
<p>Of Beatrice interrupts our song.</p>
<p>Only to yield thee gladness of my voice,</p>
<p>And of the light that vests me, I thus far</p>
<p>Descend these hallow&rsquo;d steps: not that more love</p>
<p>Invites me; for lo! there aloft, as much</p>
<p>Or more of love is witness&rsquo;d in those flames:</p>
<p>But such my lot by charity assign&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>That makes us ready servants, as thou seest,</p>
<p>To execute the counsel of the Highest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That in this court,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;O sacred lamp!</p>
<p>Love no compulsion needs, but follows free</p>
<p>Th&rsquo; eternal Providence, I well discern:</p>
<p>This harder find to deem, why of thy peers</p>
<p>Thou only to this office wert foredoom&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had not ended, when, like rapid mill,</p>
<p>Upon its centre whirl&rsquo;d the light; and then</p>
<p>The love, that did inhabit there, replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Splendour eternal, piercing through these folds,</p>
<p>Its virtue to my vision knits, and thus</p>
<p>Supported, lifts me so above myself,</p>
<p>That on the sov&rsquo;ran essence, which it wells from,</p>
<p>I have the power to gaze: and hence the joy,</p>
<p>Wherewith I sparkle, equaling with my blaze</p>
<p>The keenness of my sight. But not the soul,</p>
<p>That is in heav&rsquo;n most lustrous, nor the seraph</p>
<p>That hath his eyes most fix&rsquo;d on God, shall solve</p>
<p>What thou hast ask&rsquo;d: for in th&rsquo; abyss it lies</p>
<p>Of th&rsquo; everlasting statute sunk so low,</p>
<p>That no created ken may fathom it.</p>
<p>And, to the mortal world when thou return&rsquo;st,</p>
<p>Be this reported; that none henceforth dare</p>
<p>Direct his footsteps to so dread a bourn.</p>
<p>The mind, that here is radiant, on the earth</p>
<p>Is wrapt in mist. Look then if she may do,</p>
<p>Below, what passeth her ability,</p>
<p>When she is ta&rsquo;en to heav&rsquo;n.&rdquo; By words like these</p>
<p>Admonish&rsquo;d, I the question urg&rsquo;d no more;</p>
<p>And of the spirit humbly sued alone</p>
<p>T&rsquo; instruct me of its state. &ldquo;&rsquo;Twixt either shore</p>
<p>Of Italy, nor distant from thy land,</p>
<p>A stony ridge ariseth, in such sort,</p>
<p>The thunder doth not lift his voice so high,</p>
<p>They call it Catria: at whose foot a cell</p>
<p>Is sacred to the lonely Eremite,</p>
<p>For worship set apart and holy rites.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A third time thus it spake; then added: &ldquo;There</p>
<p>So firmly to God&rsquo;s service I adher&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>That with no costlier viands than the juice</p>
<p>Of olives, easily I pass&rsquo;d the heats</p>
<p>Of summer and the winter frosts, content</p>
<p>In heav&rsquo;n-ward musings. Rich were the returns</p>
<p>And fertile, which that cloister once was us&rsquo;d</p>
<p>To render to these heavens: now &rsquo;t is fall&rsquo;n</p>
<p>Into a waste so empty, that ere long</p>
<p>Detection must lay bare its vanity</p>
<p>Pietro Damiano there was I y-clept:</p>
<p>Pietro the sinner, when before I dwelt</p>
<p>Beside the Adriatic, in the house</p>
<p>Of our blest Lady. Near upon my close</p>
<p>Of mortal life, through much importuning</p>
<p>I was constrain&rsquo;d to wear the hat that still</p>
<p>From bad to worse it shifted.&mdash;Cephas came;</p>
<p>He came, who was the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s vessel,</p>
<p>Barefoot and lean, eating their bread, as chanc&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>At the first table. Modern Shepherd&rsquo;s need</p>
<p>Those who on either hand may prop and lead them,</p>
<p>So burly are they grown: and from behind</p>
<p>Others to hoist them. Down the palfrey&rsquo;s sides</p>
<p>Spread their broad mantles, so as both the beasts</p>
<p>Are cover&rsquo;d with one skin. O patience! thou</p>
<p>That lookst on this and doth endure so long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I at those accents saw the splendours down</p>
<p>From step to step alight, and wheel, and wax,</p>
<p>Each circuiting, more beautiful. Round this</p>
<p>They came, and stay&rsquo;d them; uttered them a shout</p>
<p>So loud, it hath no likeness here: nor I</p>
<p>Wist what it spake, so deaf&rsquo;ning was the thunder.</p>

<p>And such a speeding grace shone over me,</p>

<p>The dwellers round about, who with the world</p>
<p>Were in delusion lost. These other flames,</p>
<p>The spirits of men contemplative, were all</p>
<p>Enliven&rsquo;d by that warmth, whose kindly force</p>
<p>Gives birth to flowers and fruits of holiness.</p>

<p>Has spread to utmost amplitude. Of thee</p>
<p>Therefore entreat I, father! to declare</p>
<p>If I may gain such favour, as to gaze</p>
<p>Upon thine image, by no covering veil&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Brother!&rdquo; he thus rejoin&rsquo;d, &ldquo;in the last sphere</p>
<p>Expect completion of thy lofty aim,</p>
<p>For there on each desire completion waits,</p>
<p>And there on mine: where every aim is found</p>
<p>Perfect, entire, and for fulfillment ripe.</p>
<p>There all things are as they have ever been:</p>
<p>For space is none to bound, nor pole divides,</p>
<p>Our ladder reaches even to that clime,</p>
<p>And so at giddy distance mocks thy view.</p>
<p>Thither the Patriarch Jacob saw it stretch</p>
<p>Its topmost round, when it appear&rsquo;d to him</p>
<p>With angels laden. But to mount it now</p>
<p>None lifts his foot from earth: and hence my rule</p>
<p>Is left a profitless stain upon the leaves;</p>
<p>The walls, for abbey rear&rsquo;d, turned into dens,</p>
<p>The cowls to sacks choak&rsquo;d up with musty meal.</p>
<p>Foul usury doth not more lift itself</p>
<p>Against God&rsquo;s pleasure, than that fruit which makes</p>
<p>The hearts of monks so wanton: for whate&rsquo;er</p>
<p>Is in the church&rsquo;s keeping, all pertains.</p>
<p>To such, as sue for heav&rsquo;n&rsquo;s sweet sake, and not</p>
<p>To those who in respect of kindred claim,</p>
<p>Or on more vile allowance. Mortal flesh</p>
<p>Is grown so dainty, good beginnings last not</p>
<p>From the oak&rsquo;s birth, unto the acorn&rsquo;s setting.</p>
<p>His convent Peter founded without gold</p>
<p>Or silver; I with pray&rsquo;rs and fasting mine;</p>
<p>And Francis his in meek humility.</p>
<p>And if thou note the point, whence each proceeds,</p>
<p>Then look what it hath err&rsquo;d to, thou shalt find</p>
<p>The white grown murky. Jordan was turn&rsquo;d back;</p>
<p>And a less wonder, then the refluent sea,</p>
<p>May at God&rsquo;s pleasure work amendment here.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">So saying, to his assembly back he drew:</p>
<p>And they together cluster&rsquo;d into one,</p>
<p>Then all roll&rsquo;d upward like an eddying wind.</p>
<p class="slindent">The sweet dame beckon&rsquo;d me to follow them:</p>
<p>And, by that influence only, so prevail&rsquo;d</p>
<p>Over my nature, that no natural motion,</p>
<p>Ascending or descending here below,</p>
<p>Had, as I mounted, with my pennon vied.</p>
<p class="slindent">So, reader, as my hope is to return</p>
<p>Unto the holy triumph, for the which</p>
<p>I ofttimes wail my sins, and smite my breast,</p>
<p>Thou hadst been longer drawing out and thrusting</p>
<p>Thy finger in the fire, than I was, ere</p>
<p>The sign, that followeth Taurus, I beheld,</p>
<p>And enter&rsquo;d its precinct. O glorious stars!</p>
<p>O light impregnate with exceeding virtue!</p>
<p>To whom whate&rsquo;er of genius lifteth me</p>
<p>Above the vulgar, grateful I refer;</p>
<p>With ye the parent of all mortal life</p>
<p>Arose and set, when I did first inhale</p>
<p>The Tuscan air; and afterward, when grace</p>
<p>Vouchsaf&rsquo;d me entrance to the lofty wheel</p>
<p>That in its orb impels ye, fate decreed</p>
<p>My passage at your clime. To you my soul</p>
<p>Devoutly sighs, for virtue even now</p>
<p>To meet the hard emprize that draws me on.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Thou art so near the sum of blessedness,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said Beatrice, &ldquo;that behooves thy ken</p>
<p>Be vigilant and clear. And, to this end,</p>
<p>Or even thou advance thee further, hence</p>
<p>Look downward, and contemplate, what a world</p>
<p>Already stretched under our feet there lies:</p>
<p>So as thy heart may, in its blithest mood,</p>
<p>Present itself to the triumphal throng,</p>
<p>Which through the&rsquo; etherial concave comes rejoicing.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">I straight obey&rsquo;d; and with mine eye return&rsquo;d</p>
<p>Through all the seven spheres, and saw this globe</p>
<p>So pitiful of semblance, that perforce</p>
<p>It moved my smiles: and him in truth I hold</p>
<p>For wisest, who esteems it least: whose thoughts</p>
<p>Elsewhere are fix&rsquo;d, him worthiest call and best.</p>
<p>I saw the daughter of Latona shine</p>
<p>Without the shadow, whereof late I deem&rsquo;d</p>
<p>That dense and rare were cause. Here I sustain&rsquo;d</p>
<p>The visage, Hyperion! of thy sun;</p>
<p>And mark&rsquo;d, how near him with their circle, round</p>
<p>Move Maia and Dione; here discern&rsquo;d</p>
<p>Jove&rsquo;s tempering &rsquo;twixt his sire and son; and hence</p>
<p>Their changes and their various aspects</p>
<p>Distinctly scann&rsquo;d. Nor might I not descry</p>
<p>Of all the seven, how bulky each, how swift;</p>
<p>Nor of their several distances not learn.</p>
<p>This petty area (o&rsquo;er the which we stride</p>
<p>So fiercely), as along the eternal twins</p>
<p>I wound my way, appear&rsquo;d before me all,</p>
<p>Forth from the havens stretch&rsquo;d unto the hills.</p>
<p>Then to the beauteous eyes mine eyes return&rsquo;d.</p>
</div>`,
`<p class="cantohead">Canto XXIII</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>E&rsquo;en as the bird, who midst the leafy bower</p>
<p>Has, in her nest, sat darkling through the night,</p>
<p>With her sweet brood, impatient to descry</p>
<p>Their wished looks, and to bring home their food,</p>
<p>In the fond quest unconscious of her toil:</p>
<p>She, of the time prevenient, on the spray,</p>
<p>That overhangs their couch, with wakeful gaze</p>
<p>Expects the sun; nor ever, till the dawn,</p>
<p>Removeth from the east her eager ken;</p>
<p>So stood the dame erect, and bent her glance</p>
<p>Wistfully on that region, where the sun</p>
<p>Abateth most his speed; that, seeing her</p>
<p>Suspense and wand&rsquo;ring, I became as one,</p>
<p>In whom desire is waken&rsquo;d, and the hope</p>
<p>Of somewhat new to come fills with delight.</p>
<p class="slindent">Short space ensued; I was not held, I say,</p>
<p>Long in expectance, when I saw the heav&rsquo;n</p>
<p>Wax more and more resplendent; and, &ldquo;Behold,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cried Beatrice, &ldquo;the triumphal hosts</p>
<p>Of Christ, and all the harvest reap&rsquo;d at length</p>
<p>Of thy ascending up these spheres.&rdquo; Meseem&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>That, while she spake her image all did burn,</p>
<p>And in her eyes such fullness was of joy,</p>
<p>And I am fain to pass unconstrued by.</p>
<p class="slindent">As in the calm full moon, when Trivia smiles,</p>
<p>In peerless beauty, &rsquo;mid th&rsquo; eternal nympus,</p>
<p>That paint through all its gulfs the blue profound</p>
<p>In bright pre-eminence so saw I there,</p>
<p>O&rsquo;er million lamps a sun, from whom all drew</p>
<p>Their radiance as from ours the starry train:</p>
<p>And through the living light so lustrous glow&rsquo;d</p>
<p>The substance, that my ken endur&rsquo;d it not.</p>
<p class="slindent">O Beatrice! sweet and precious guide!</p>
<p>Who cheer&rsquo;d me with her comfortable words!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Against the virtue, that o&rsquo;erpow&rsquo;reth thee,</p>
<p>Avails not to resist. Here is the might,</p>
<p>And here the wisdom, which did open lay</p>
<p>The path, that had been yearned for so long,</p>
<p>Betwixt the heav&rsquo;n and earth.&rdquo; Like to the fire,</p>
<p>That, in a cloud imprison&rsquo;d doth break out</p>
<p>Expansive, so that from its womb enlarg&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>It falleth against nature to the ground;</p>
<p>Thus in that heav&rsquo;nly banqueting my soul</p>
<p>Outgrew herself; and, in the transport lost.</p>
<p>Holds now remembrance none of what she was.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Ope thou thine eyes, and mark me: thou hast seen</p>
<p>Things, that empower thee to sustain my smile.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">I was as one, when a forgotten dream</p>
<p>Doth come across him, and he strives in vain</p>
<p>To shape it in his fantasy again,</p>
<p>Whenas that gracious boon was proffer&rsquo;d me,</p>
<p>Which never may be cancel&rsquo;d from the book,</p>
<p>Wherein the past is written. Now were all</p>
<p>Those tongues to sound, that have on sweetest milk</p>
<p>Of Polyhymnia and her sisters fed</p>
<p>And fatten&rsquo;d, not with all their help to boot,</p>
<p>Unto the thousandth parcel of the truth,</p>
<p>My song might shadow forth that saintly smile,</p>
<p>flow merely in her saintly looks it wrought.</p>
<p>And with such figuring of Paradise</p>
<p>The sacred strain must leap, like one, that meets</p>
<p>A sudden interruption to his road.</p>
<p>But he, who thinks how ponderous the theme,</p>
<p>And that &rsquo;t is lain upon a mortal shoulder,</p>
<p>May pardon, if it tremble with the burden.</p>
<p>The track, our ventrous keel must furrow, brooks</p>
<p>No unribb&rsquo;d pinnace, no self-sparing pilot.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Why doth my face,&rdquo; said Beatrice, &ldquo;thus</p>
<p>Enamour thee, as that thou dost not turn</p>
<p>Unto the beautiful garden, blossoming</p>
<p>Beneath the rays of Christ? Here is the rose,</p>
<p>Wherein the word divine was made incarnate;</p>
<p>And here the lilies, by whose odour known</p>
<p>The way of life was follow&rsquo;d.&rdquo; Prompt I heard</p>
<p>Her bidding, and encounter once again</p>
<p>The strife of aching vision. As erewhile,</p>
<p>Through glance of sunlight, stream&rsquo;d through broken cloud,</p>
<p>Mine eyes a flower-besprinkled mead have seen,</p>
<p>Though veil&rsquo;d themselves in shade; so saw I there</p>
<p>Legions of splendours, on whom burning rays</p>
<p>Shed lightnings from above, yet saw I not</p>
<p>The fountain whence they flow&rsquo;d. O gracious virtue!</p>
<p>Thou, whose broad stamp is on them, higher up</p>
<p>Thou didst exalt thy glory to give room</p>
<p>To my o&rsquo;erlabour&rsquo;d sight: when at the name</p>
<p>Of that fair flower, whom duly I invoke</p>
<p>Both morn and eve, my soul, with all her might</p>
<p>Collected, on the goodliest ardour fix&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>And, as the bright dimensions of the star</p>
<p>In heav&rsquo;n excelling, as once here on earth</p>
<p>Were, in my eyeballs lively portray&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>Lo! from within the sky a cresset fell,</p>
<p>Circling in fashion of a diadem,</p>
<p>And girt the star, and hov&rsquo;ring round it wheel&rsquo;d.</p>
<p class="slindent">Whatever melody sounds sweetest here,</p>
<p>And draws the spirit most unto itself,</p>
<p>Might seem a rent cloud when it grates the thunder,</p>
<p>Compar&rsquo;d unto the sounding of that lyre,</p>
<p>Wherewith the goodliest sapphire, that inlays</p>
<p>The floor of heav&rsquo;n, was crown&rsquo;d. &ldquo;Angelic Love</p>
<p>I am, who thus with hov&rsquo;ring flight enwheel</p>
<p>The lofty rapture from that womb inspir&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>Where our desire did dwell: and round thee so,</p>
<p>Lady of Heav&rsquo;n! will hover; long as thou</p>
<p>Thy Son shalt follow, and diviner joy</p>
<p>Shall from thy presence gild the highest sphere.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Such close was to the circling melody:</p>
<p>And, as it ended, all the other lights</p>
<p>Took up the strain, and echoed Mary&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p class="slindent">The robe, that with its regal folds enwraps</p>
<p>The world, and with the nearer breath of God</p>
<p>Doth burn and quiver, held so far retir&rsquo;d</p>
<p>Its inner hem and skirting over us,</p>
<p>That yet no glimmer of its majesty</p>
<p>Had stream&rsquo;d unto me: therefore were mine eyes</p>
<p>Unequal to pursue the crowned flame,</p>
<p>That rose and sought its natal seed of fire;</p>
<p>And like to babe, that stretches forth its arms</p>
<p>For very eagerness towards the breast,</p>
<p>After the milk is taken; so outstretch&rsquo;d</p>
<p>Their wavy summits all the fervent band,</p>
<p>Through zealous love to Mary: then in view</p>
<p>There halted, and &ldquo;Regina Coeli&rdquo; sang</p>
<p>So sweetly, the delight hath left me never.</p>
<p class="slindent">O what o&rsquo;erflowing plenty is up-pil&rsquo;d</p>
<p>In those rich-laden coffers, which below</p>
<p>Sow&rsquo;d the good seed, whose harvest now they keep.</p>
<p class="slindent">Here are the treasures tasted, that with tears</p>
<p>Were in the Babylonian exile won,</p>
<p>When gold had fail&rsquo;d them. Here in synod high</p>
<p>Of ancient council with the new conven&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>Under the Son of Mary and of God,</p>
<p>Victorious he his mighty triumph holds,</p>

<p>And the rejoicing spirits, like to spheres</p>
<p>On firm-set poles revolving, trail&rsquo;d a blaze</p>
<p>Of comet splendour; and as wheels, that wind</p>
<p>Their circles in the horologe, so work</p>
<p>The stated rounds, that to th&rsquo; observant eye</p>
<p>The first seems still, and, as it flew, the last;</p>
<p>E&rsquo;en thus their carols weaving variously,</p>
<p>They by the measure pac&rsquo;d, or swift, or slow,</p>
<p>Made me to rate the riches of their joy.</p>
<p class="slindent">From that, which I did note in beauty most</p>
<p>Excelling, saw I issue forth a flame</p>
<p>So bright, as none was left more goodly there.</p>
<p>Round Beatrice thrice it wheel&rsquo;d about,</p>
<p>With so divine a song, that fancy&rsquo;s ear</p>
<p>Records it not; and the pen passeth on</p>
<p>And leaves a blank: for that our mortal speech,</p>
<p>Nor e&rsquo;en the inward shaping of the brain,</p>
<p>Hath colours fine enough to trace such folds.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;O saintly sister mine! thy prayer devout</p>
<p>Is with so vehement affection urg&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>Thou dost unbind me from that beauteous sphere.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Such were the accents towards my lady breath&rsquo;d</p>
<p>From that blest ardour, soon as it was stay&rsquo;d:</p>
<p>To whom she thus: &ldquo;O everlasting light</p>

<p>Did leave the keys, which of this wondrous bliss</p>
<p>He bare below! tent this man, as thou wilt,</p>
<p>With lighter probe or deep, touching the faith,</p>
<p>By the which thou didst on the billows walk.</p>
<p>If he in love, in hope, and in belief,</p>
<p>Be steadfast, is not hid from thee: for thou</p>
<p>Hast there thy ken, where all things are beheld</p>
<p>In liveliest portraiture. But since true faith</p>
<p>Has peopled this fair realm with citizens,</p>
<p>Meet is, that to exalt its glory more,</p>
<p>Thou in his audience shouldst thereof discourse.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Like to the bachelor, who arms himself,</p>
<p>And speaks not, till the master have propos&rsquo;d</p>
<p>The question, to approve, and not to end it;</p>
<p>So I, in silence, arm&rsquo;d me, while she spake,</p>
<p>Summoning up each argument to aid;</p>
<p>As was behooveful for such questioner,</p>
<p>And such profession: &ldquo;As good Christian ought,</p>
<p>Declare thee, What is faith?&rdquo; Whereat I rais&rsquo;d</p>
<p>My forehead to the light, whence this had breath&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>Then turn&rsquo;d to Beatrice, and in her looks</p>
<p>Approval met, that from their inmost fount</p>
<p>I should unlock the waters. &ldquo;May the grace,</p>
<p>That giveth me the captain of the church</p>
<p>For confessor,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;vouchsafe to me</p>
<p>Apt utterance for my thoughts!&rdquo; then added: &ldquo;Sire!</p>
<p>E&rsquo;en as set down by the unerring style</p>
<p>Of thy dear brother, who with thee conspir&rsquo;d</p>
<p>To bring Rome in unto the way of life,</p>
<p>Faith of things hop&rsquo;d is substance, and the proof</p>
<p>Of things not seen; and herein doth consist</p>
<p>Methinks its essence,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Rightly hast thou deem&rsquo;d,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Was answer&rsquo;d: &ldquo;if thou well discern, why first</p>
<p>He hath defin&rsquo;d it, substance, and then proof.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;The deep things,&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;which here I scan</p>
<p>Distinctly, are below from mortal eye</p>
<p>So hidden, they have in belief alone</p>
<p>Their being, on which credence hope sublime</p>

<p>And inasmuch as we must needs infer</p>
<p>From such belief our reasoning, all respect</p>
<p>To other view excluded, hence of proof</p>
<p>Th&rsquo; intention is deriv&rsquo;d.&rdquo; Forthwith I heard:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If thus, whate&rsquo;er by learning men attain,</p>
<p>Were understood, the sophist would want room</p>
<p>To exercise his wit.&rdquo; So breath&rsquo;d the flame</p>
<p>Of love: then added: &ldquo;Current is the coin</p>
<p>Thou utter&rsquo;st, both in weight and in alloy.</p>
<p>But tell me, if thou hast it in thy purse.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Even so glittering and so round,&rdquo; said I,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I not a whit misdoubt of its assay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, whence the costly jewel, on the which</p>
<p>Is founded every virtue, came to thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The flood,&rdquo; I answer&rsquo;d, &ldquo;from the Spirit of God</p>
<p>Rain&rsquo;d down upon the ancient bond and new,&mdash;</p>
<p>Here is the reas&rsquo;ning, that convinceth me</p>
<p>So feelingly, each argument beside</p>
<p>Seems blunt and forceless in comparison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then heard I: &ldquo;Wherefore holdest thou that each,</p>
<p>The elder proposition and the new,</p>
<p>Which so persuade thee, are the voice of heav&rsquo;n?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;The works, that follow&rsquo;d, evidence their truth; &rdquo;</p>
<p>I answer&rsquo;d: &ldquo;Nature did not make for these</p>
<p>The iron hot, or on her anvil mould them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who voucheth to thee of the works themselves,</p>
<p>Was the reply, &ldquo;that they in very deed</p>
<p>Are that they purport? None hath sworn so to thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;That all the world,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;should have bee turn&rsquo;d</p>
<p>To Christian, and no miracle been wrought,</p>
<p>Would in itself be such a miracle,</p>

<p>E&rsquo;en thou wentst forth in poverty and hunger</p>
<p>To set the goodly plant, that from the vine,</p>
<p>It once was, now is grown unsightly bramble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That ended, through the high celestial court</p>
<p>Resounded all the spheres. &ldquo;Praise we one God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In song of most unearthly melody.</p>
<p>And when that Worthy thus, from branch to branch,</p>
<p>Examining, had led me, that we now</p>
<p>Approach&rsquo;d the topmost bough, he straight resum&rsquo;d;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The grace, that holds sweet dalliance with thy soul,</p>

<p>That, whatsoe&rsquo;er has past them, I commend.</p>
<p>Behooves thee to express, what thou believ&rsquo;st,</p>
<p>The next, and whereon thy belief hath grown.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;O saintly sire and spirit!&rdquo; I began,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who seest that, which thou didst so believe,</p>
<p>As to outstrip feet younger than thine own,</p>
<p>Toward the sepulchre? thy will is here,</p>
<p>That I the tenour of my creed unfold;</p>
<p>And thou the cause of it hast likewise ask&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>And I reply: I in one God believe,</p>
<p>One sole eternal Godhead, of whose love</p>
<p>All heav&rsquo;n is mov&rsquo;d, himself unmov&rsquo;d the while.</p>
<p>Nor demonstration physical alone,</p>
<p>Or more intelligential and abstruse,</p>
<p>Persuades me to this faith; but from that truth</p>
<p>It cometh to me rather, which is shed</p>
<p>Through Moses, the rapt Prophets, and the Psalms.</p>
<p>The Gospel, and that ye yourselves did write,</p>
<p>When ye were gifted of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>In three eternal Persons I believe,</p>
<p>Essence threefold and one, mysterious league</p>
<p>Of union absolute, which, many a time,</p>
<p>The word of gospel lore upon my mind</p>
<p>Imprints: and from this germ, this firstling spark,</p>
<p>The lively flame dilates, and like heav&rsquo;n&rsquo;s star</p>
<p>Doth glitter in me.&rsquo;&rsquo; As the master hears,</p>
<p>Well pleas&rsquo;d, and then enfoldeth in his arms</p>
<p>The servant, who hath joyful tidings brought,</p>
<p>And having told the errand keeps his peace;</p>
<p>Thus benediction uttering with song</p>
<p>Soon as my peace I held, compass&rsquo;d me thrice</p>

<p>Arriveth, must be ripen&rsquo;d in our beam.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Such cheering accents from the second flame</p>
<p>Assur&rsquo;d me; and mine eyes I lifted up</p>
<p>Unto the mountains that had bow&rsquo;d them late</p>
<p>With over-heavy burden. &ldquo;Sith our Liege</p>
<p>Wills of his grace that thou, or ere thy death,</p>
<p>In the most secret council, with his lords</p>
<p>Shouldst be confronted, so that having view&rsquo;d</p>
<p>The glories of our court, thou mayst therewith</p>
<p>Thyself, and all who hear, invigorate</p>
<p>With hope, that leads to blissful end; declare,</p>
<p>What is that hope, how it doth flourish in thee,</p>
<p>And whence thou hadst it?&rdquo; Thus proceeding still,</p>
<p>The second light: and she, whose gentle love</p>
<p>My soaring pennons in that lofty flight</p>
<p>Escorted, thus preventing me, rejoin&rsquo;d:</p>
<p>Among her sons, not one more full of hope,</p>
<p>Hath the church militant: so &rsquo;t is of him</p>
<p>Recorded in the sun, whose liberal orb</p>
<p>Enlighteneth all our tribe: and ere his term</p>
<p>Of warfare, hence permitted he is come,</p>
<p>From Egypt to Jerusalem, to see.</p>
<p>The other points, both which thou hast inquir&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>Not for more knowledge, but that he may tell</p>
<p>How dear thou holdst the virtue, these to him</p>
<p>Leave I; for he may answer thee with ease,</p>
<p>And without boasting, so God give him grace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Like to the scholar, practis&rsquo;d in his task,</p>
<p>Who, willing to give proof of diligence,</p>
<p>Seconds his teacher gladly, &ldquo;Hope,&rdquo; said I,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is of the joy to come a sure expectance,</p>
<p>Th&rsquo; effect of grace divine and merit preceding.</p>
<p>This light from many a star visits my heart,</p>
<p>But flow&rsquo;d to me the first from him, who sang</p>
<p>The songs of the Supreme, himself supreme</p>
<p>Among his tuneful brethren. &lsquo;Let all hope</p>
<p>In thee,&rsquo; so speak his anthem, &lsquo;who have known</p>
<p>Thy name;&rsquo; and with my faith who know not that?</p>
<p>From thee, the next, distilling from his spring,</p>
<p>In thine epistle, fell on me the drops</p>
<p>So plenteously, that I on others shower</p>
<p>The influence of their dew.&rdquo; Whileas I spake,</p>
<p>A lamping, as of quick and vollied lightning,</p>
<p>Within the bosom of that mighty sheen,</p>
<p>Play&rsquo;d tremulous; then forth these accents breath&rsquo;d:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Love for the virtue which attended me</p>
<p>E&rsquo;en to the palm, and issuing from the field,</p>
<p>Glows vigorous yet within me, and inspires</p>
<p>To ask of thee, whom also it delights;</p>
<p>What promise thou from hope in chief dost win.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Both scriptures, new and ancient,&rdquo; I reply&rsquo;d;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Propose the mark (which even now I view)</p>
<p>For souls belov&rsquo;d of God. Isaias saith,</p>
<p class="slindent">That, in their own land, each one must be clad</p>
<p>In twofold vesture; and their proper lands this delicious life.</p>
<p>In terms more full,</p>
<p>And clearer far, thy brother hath set forth</p>
<p>This revelation to us, where he tells</p>
<p>Of the white raiment destin&rsquo;d to the saints.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, as the words were ending, from above,</p>
<p>&ldquo;They hope in thee,&rdquo; first heard we cried: whereto</p>
<p>Answer&rsquo;d the carols all. Amidst them next,</p>
<p>A light of so clear amplitude emerg&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>That winter&rsquo;s month were but a single day,</p>
<p>Were such a crystal in the Cancer&rsquo;s sign.</p>
<p class="slindent">Like as a virgin riseth up, and goes,</p>
<p>And enters on the mazes of the dance,</p>
<p>Though gay, yet innocent of worse intent,</p>
<p>Than to do fitting honour to the bride;</p>
<p>So I beheld the new effulgence come</p>
<p>Unto the other two, who in a ring</p>
<p>Wheel&rsquo;d, as became their rapture. In the dance</p>
<p>And in the song it mingled. And the dame</p>
<p>Held on them fix&rsquo;d her looks: e&rsquo;en as the spouse</p>
<p>Silent and moveless. &ldquo;This is he, who lay</p>
<p>Upon the bosom of our pelican:</p>
<p>This he, into whose keeping from the cross</p>
<p>The mighty charge was given.&rdquo; Thus she spake,</p>
<p>Yet therefore naught the more remov&rsquo;d her Sight</p>
<p>From marking them, or ere her words began,</p>
<p>Or when they clos&rsquo;d. As he, who looks intent,</p>
<p>And strives with searching ken, how he may see</p>
<p>The sun in his eclipse, and, through desire</p>
<p>Of seeing, loseth power of sight: so I</p>
<p>Peer&rsquo;d on that last resplendence, while I heard:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why dazzlest thou thine eyes in seeking that,</p>
<p>Which here abides not? Earth my body is,</p>
<p>In earth: and shall be, with the rest, so long,</p>
<p>As till our number equal the decree</p>
<p>Of the Most High. The two that have ascended,</p>
<p>In this our blessed cloister, shine alone</p>
<p>With the two garments. So report below.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">As when, for ease of labour, or to shun</p>
<p>Suspected peril at a whistle&rsquo;s breath,</p>
<p>The oars, erewhile dash&rsquo;d frequent in the wave,</p>
<p>All rest; the flamy circle at that voice</p>
<p>So rested, and the mingling sound was still,</p>
<p>Which from the trinal band soft-breathing rose.</p>
<p>I turn&rsquo;d, but ah! how trembled in my thought,</p>
<p>When, looking at my side again to see</p>
<p>Beatrice, I descried her not, although</p>
<p>Not distant, on the happy coast she stood.</p>

<p>Forth of the beamy flame which dazzled me,</p>

<p>That, long as till thy vision, on my form</p>

<p>Is but o&rsquo;erpowered a space, not wholly quench&rsquo;d:</p>
<p>Since thy fair guide and lovely, in her look</p>
<p>Hath potency, the like to that which dwelt</p>
<p>In Ananias&rsquo; hand.&rsquo;&rsquo; I answering thus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be to mine eyes the remedy or late</p>
<p>Or early, at her pleasure; for they were</p>
<p>The gates, at which she enter&rsquo;d, and did light</p>
<p>Her never dying fire. My wishes here</p>
<p>Are centered; in this palace is the weal,</p>
<p>That Alpha and Omega, is to all</p>
<p>The lessons love can read me.&rdquo; Yet again</p>
<p>The voice which had dispers&rsquo;d my fear, when daz&rsquo;d</p>
<p>With that excess, to converse urg&rsquo;d, and spake:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Behooves thee sift more narrowly thy terms,</p>
<p>And say, who level&rsquo;d at this scope thy bow.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Philosophy,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;hath arguments,</p>

<p>Kindles our love, and in degree the more,</p>
<p>As it comprises more of goodness in &rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The essence then, where such advantage is,</p>
<p>That each good, found without it, is naught else</p>
<p>But of his light the beam, must needs attract</p>
<p>The soul of each one, loving, who the truth</p>
<p>Discerns, on which this proof is built. Such truth</p>
<p>Learn I from him, who shows me the first love</p>
<p>Of all intelligential substances</p>
<p>Eternal: from his voice I learn, whose word</p>
<p>Is truth, that of himself to Moses saith,</p>
<p>&lsquo;I will make all my good before thee pass.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Lastly from thee I learn, who chief proclaim&rsquo;st,</p>

<p>In mortal ears the mystery of heav&rsquo;n.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Through human wisdom, and th&rsquo; authority</p>

<p>Had pointed his demand; yea noted well</p>
<p>Th&rsquo; avowal, which he led to; and resum&rsquo;d:</p>
<p>&ldquo;All grappling bonds, that knit the heart to God,</p>
<p>Confederate to make fast our clarity.</p>
<p>The being of the world, and mine own being,</p>
<p>The death which he endur&rsquo;d that I should live,</p>
<p>And that, which all the faithful hope, as I do,</p>
<p>To the foremention&rsquo;d lively knowledge join&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>Have from the sea of ill love sav&rsquo;d my bark,</p>
<p>And on the coast secur&rsquo;d it of the right.</p>
<p>As for the leaves, that in the garden bloom,</p>
<p>My love for them is great, as is the good</p>
<p>Dealt by th&rsquo; eternal hand, that tends them all.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">I ended, and therewith a song most sweet</p>
<p>Rang through the spheres; and &ldquo;Holy, holy, holy,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Accordant with the rest my lady sang.</p>
<p>And as a sleep is broken and dispers&rsquo;d</p>
<p>Through sharp encounter of the nimble light,</p>
<p>With the eye&rsquo;s spirit running forth to meet</p>
<p>The ray, from membrane on to the membrane urg&rsquo;d;</p>
<p>And the upstartled wight loathes that be sees;</p>
<p>So, at his sudden waking, he misdeems</p>
<p>Of all around him, till assurance waits</p>
<p>On better judgment: thus the saintly came</p>
<p>Drove from before mine eyes the motes away,</p>
<p>With the resplendence of her own, that cast</p>
<p>Their brightness downward, thousand miles below.</p>
<p>Whence I my vision, clearer shall before,</p>
<p>Recover&rsquo;d; and, well nigh astounded, ask&rsquo;d</p>
<p>Of a fourth light, that now with us I saw.</p>
<p class="slindent">And Beatrice: &ldquo;The first diving soul,</p>
<p>That ever the first virtue fram&rsquo;d, admires</p>
<p>Within these rays his Maker.&rdquo; Like the leaf,</p>
<p>That bows its lithe top till the blast is blown;</p>
<p>By its own virtue rear&rsquo;d then stands aloof;</p>
<p>So I, the whilst she said, awe-stricken bow&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>Then eagerness to speak embolden&rsquo;d me;</p>
<p>And I began: &ldquo;O fruit! that wast alone</p>
<p>Mature, when first engender&rsquo;d! Ancient father!</p>
<p>That doubly seest in every wedded bride</p>
<p>Thy daughter by affinity and blood!</p>
<p>Devoutly as I may, I pray thee hold</p>
<p>Converse with me: my will thou seest; and I,</p>
<p>More speedily to hear thee, tell it not &rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">It chanceth oft some animal bewrays,</p>
<p>Through the sleek cov&rsquo;ring of his furry coat.</p>
<p>The fondness, that stirs in him and conforms</p>
<p>His outside seeming to the cheer within:</p>
<p>And in like guise was Adam&rsquo;s spirit mov&rsquo;d</p>
<p>To joyous mood, that through the covering shone,</p>
<p>Transparent, when to pleasure me it spake:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need thy will be told, which I untold</p>
<p>Better discern, than thou whatever thing</p>
<p>Thou holdst most certain: for that will I see</p>
<p>In Him, who is truth&rsquo;s mirror, and Himself</p>
<p>Parhelion unto all things, and naught else</p>
<p>To him. This wouldst thou hear; how long since God</p>
<p>Plac&rsquo;d me high garden, from whose hounds</p>
<p>She led me up in this ladder, steep and long;</p>
<p>What space endur&rsquo;d my season of delight;</p>
<p>Whence truly sprang the wrath that banish&rsquo;d me;</p>
<p>And what the language, which I spake and fram&rsquo;d</p>
<p>Not that I tasted of the tree, my son,</p>
<p>Was in itself the cause of that exile,</p>
<p>But only my transgressing of the mark</p>
<p>Assign&rsquo;d me. There, whence at thy lady&rsquo;s hest</p>
<p>The Mantuan mov&rsquo;d him, still was I debarr&rsquo;d</p>
<p>This council, till the sun had made complete,</p>
<p>Four thousand and three hundred rounds and twice,</p>
<p>His annual journey; and, through every light</p>
<p>In his broad pathway, saw I him return,</p>
<p>Thousand save sev&rsquo;nty times, the whilst I dwelt</p>
<p>Upon the earth. The language I did use</p>
<p>Was worn away, or ever Nimrod&rsquo;s race</p>
<p>Their unaccomplishable work began.</p>
<p>For naught, that man inclines to, ere was lasting,</p>
<p>Left by his reason free, and variable,</p>
<p>As is the sky that sways him. That he speaks,</p>
<p>Is nature&rsquo;s prompting: whether thus or thus,</p>
<p>She leaves to you, as ye do most affect it.</p>
<p>Ere I descended into hell&rsquo;s abyss,</p>
<p>El was the name on earth of the Chief Good,</p>
<p>Whose joy enfolds me: Eli then &rsquo;t was call&rsquo;d</p>
<p>And so beseemeth: for, in mortals, use</p>
<p>Is as the leaf upon the bough; that goes,</p>
<p>And other comes instead. Upon the mount</p>
<p>Most high above the waters, all my life,</p>
<p>Both innocent and guilty, did but reach</p>
<p>From the first hour, to that which cometh next</p>
<p>(As the sun changes quarter), to the sixth.</p>

<p>And interchang&rsquo;d their plumes. Silence ensued,</p>
<p>Through the blest quire, by Him, who here appoints</p>
<p>Vicissitude of ministry, enjoin&rsquo;d;</p>
<p>When thus I heard: &ldquo;Wonder not, if my hue</p>

<p>All in like manner change with me. My place</p>
<p>He who usurps on earth (my place, ay, mine,</p>
<p>Which in the presence of the Son of God</p>
<p>Is void), the same hath made my cemetery</p>
<p>A common sewer of puddle and of blood:</p>
<p>The more below his triumph, who from hence</p>
<p>Malignant fell.&rdquo; Such colour, as the sun,</p>
<p>At eve or morning, paints and adverse cloud,</p>
<p>Then saw I sprinkled over all the sky.</p>
<p>And as th&rsquo; unblemish&rsquo;d dame, who in herself</p>
<p>Secure of censure, yet at bare report</p>
<p>Of other&rsquo;s failing, shrinks with maiden fear;</p>
<p>So Beatrice in her semblance chang&rsquo;d:</p>
<p>And such eclipse in heav&rsquo;n methinks was seen,</p>
<p>When the Most Holy suffer&rsquo;d. Then the words</p>
<p>Proceeded, with voice, alter&rsquo;d from itself</p>
<p>So clean, the semblance did not alter more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to this end was Christ&rsquo;s spouse with my blood,</p>
<p>With that of Linus, and of Cletus fed:</p>
<p>That she might serve for purchase of base gold:</p>
<p>But for the purchase of this happy life</p>
<p>Did Sextus, Pius, and Callixtus bleed,</p>
<p>And Urban, they, whose doom was not without</p>
<p>Much weeping seal&rsquo;d. No purpose was of our</p>
<p>That on the right hand of our successors</p>
<p>Part of the Christian people should be set,</p>
<p>And part upon their left; nor that the keys,</p>
<p>Which were vouchsaf&rsquo;d me, should for ensign serve</p>
<p>Unto the banners, that do levy war</p>
<p>On the baptiz&rsquo;d: nor I, for sigil-mark</p>

<p>To what a vile conclusion must thou stoop!</p>
<p>But the high providence, which did defend</p>
<p>Through Scipio the world&rsquo;s glory unto Rome,</p>
<p>Will not delay its succour: and thou, son,</p>
<p>Who through thy mortal weight shall yet again</p>
<p>Return below, open thy lips, nor hide</p>
<p>What is by me not hidden.&rdquo; As a Hood</p>
<p>Of frozen vapours streams adown the air,</p>
<p>What time the she-goat with her skiey horn</p>
<p>Touches the sun; so saw I there stream wide</p>
<p>The vapours, who with us had linger&rsquo;d late</p>
<p>And with glad triumph deck th&rsquo; ethereal cope.</p>
<p>Onward my sight their semblances pursued;</p>
<p>So far pursued, as till the space between</p>
<p>From its reach sever&rsquo;d them: whereat the guide</p>
<p>Celestial, marking me no more intent</p>
<p>On upward gazing, said, &ldquo;Look down and see</p>
<p>What circuit thou hast compass&rsquo;d.&rdquo; From the hour</p>
<p>When I before had cast my view beneath,</p>

<p>The unwise passage of Laertes&rsquo; son,</p>
<p>And hitherward the shore, where thou, Europa!</p>
<p>Mad&rsquo;st thee a joyful burden: and yet more</p>
<p>Of this dim spot had seen, but that the sun,</p>
<p>A constellation off and more, had ta&rsquo;en</p>
<p>His progress in the zodiac underneath.</p>
<p class="slindent">Then by the spirit, that doth never leave</p>
<p>Its amorous dalliance with my lady&rsquo;s looks,</p>
<p>Back with redoubled ardour were mine eyes</p>
<p>Led unto her: and from her radiant smiles,</p>
<p>Whenas I turn&rsquo;d me, pleasure so divine</p>
<p>Did lighten on me, that whatever bait</p>
<p>Or art or nature in the human flesh,</p>
<p>Or in its limn&rsquo;d resemblance, can combine</p>
<p>Through greedy eyes to take the soul withal,</p>

<p>Seem&rsquo;d from her visage shining, thus began:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is the goal, whence motion on his race</p>

<p>Wherein the love, which ruleth o&rsquo;er its orb,</p>
<p>Is kindled, and the virtue that it sheds;</p>
<p>One circle, light and love, enclasping it,</p>
<p>As this doth clasp the others; and to Him,</p>
<p>Who draws the bound, its limit only known.</p>
<p>Measur&rsquo;d itself by none, it doth divide</p>
<p>Motion to all, counted unto them forth,</p>
<p>As by the fifth or half ye count forth ten.</p>
<p>The vase, wherein time&rsquo;s roots are plung&rsquo;d, thou seest,</p>
<p>Look elsewhere for the leaves. O mortal lust!</p>
<p>That canst not lift thy head above the waves</p>
<p>Which whelm and sink thee down! The will in man</p>
<p>Bears goodly blossoms; but its ruddy promise</p>
<p>Is, by the dripping of perpetual rain,</p>
<p>Made mere abortion: faith and innocence</p>
<p>Are met with but in babes, each taking leave</p>
<p>Ere cheeks with down are sprinkled; he, that fasts,</p>
<p>While yet a stammerer, with his tongue let loose</p>
<p>Gluts every food alike in every moon.</p>
<p>One yet a babbler, loves and listens to</p>
<p>His mother; but no sooner hath free use</p>
<p>Of speech, than he doth wish her in her grave.</p>
<p>So suddenly doth the fair child of him,</p>

<p>Circumference so ample, that its bow,</p>

<p>lied scarce been held entire. Beyond the sev&rsquo;nth,</p>
<p>Follow&rsquo;d yet other two. And every one,</p>

<p>Had I but witness&rsquo;d order, in the world</p>
<p>Appointed, such as in these wheels is seen.</p>
<p>But in the sensible world such diff&rsquo;rence is,</p>
<p>That is each round shows more divinity,</p>
<p>As each is wider from the centre. Hence,</p>
<p>If in this wondrous and angelic temple,</p>
<p>That hath for confine only light and love,</p>
<p>My wish may have completion I must know,</p>
<p>Wherefore such disagreement is between</p>
<p>Th&rsquo; exemplar and its copy: for myself,</p>
<p>Contemplating, I fail to pierce the cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;It is no marvel, if thy fingers foil&rsquo;d</p>
<p>Do leave the knot untied: so hard &rsquo;t is grown</p>
<p>For want of tenting.&rdquo; Thus she said: &ldquo;But take,&rdquo;</p>
<p>She added, &ldquo;if thou wish thy cure, my words,</p>
<p>And entertain them subtly. Every orb</p>
<p>Corporeal, doth proportion its extent</p>
<p>Unto the virtue through its parts diffus&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>The greater blessedness preserves the more.</p>
<p>The greater is the body (if all parts</p>
<p>Share equally) the more is to preserve.</p>
<p>Therefore the circle, whose swift course enwheels</p>
<p>The universal frame answers to that,</p>
<p>Which is supreme in knowledge and in love</p>
<p>Thus by the virtue, not the seeming, breadth</p>
<p>Of substance, measure, thou shalt see the heav&rsquo;ns,</p>
<p>Each to the&rsquo; intelligence that ruleth it,</p>
<p>Greater to more, and smaller unto less,</p>
<p>Suited in strict and wondrous harmony.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">As when the sturdy north blows from his cheek</p>
<p>A blast, that scours the sky, forthwith our air,</p>
<p>Clear&rsquo;d of the rack, that hung on it before,</p>
<p>Glitters; and, With his beauties all unveil&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>The firmament looks forth serene, and smiles;</p>
<p>Such was my cheer, when Beatrice drove</p>
<p>With clear reply the shadows back, and truth</p>
<p>Was manifested, as a star in heaven.</p>
<p>And when the words were ended, not unlike</p>
<p>To iron in the furnace, every cirque</p>
<p>Ebullient shot forth scintillating fires:</p>
<p>And every sparkle shivering to new blaze,</p>
<p>In number did outmillion the account</p>
<p>Reduplicate upon the chequer&rsquo;d board.</p>
<p>Then heard I echoing on from choir to choir,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hosanna,&rdquo; to the fixed point, that holds,</p>
<p>And shall for ever hold them to their place,</p>
<p>From everlasting, irremovable.</p>
<p class="slindent">Musing awhile I stood: and she, who saw</p>
<p>by inward meditations, thus began:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first circles, they, whom thou beheldst,</p>
<p>Are seraphim and cherubim. Thus swift</p>
<p>Follow their hoops, in likeness to the point,</p>
<p>Near as they can, approaching; and they can</p>
<p>The more, the loftier their vision. Those,</p>
<p>That round them fleet, gazing the Godhead next,</p>
<p>Are thrones; in whom the first trine ends. And all</p>
<p>Are blessed, even as their sight descends</p>
<p>Deeper into the truth, wherein rest is</p>
<p>For every mind. Thus happiness hath root</p>
<p>In seeing, not in loving, which of sight</p>
<p>Is aftergrowth. And of the seeing such</p>
<p>The meed, as unto each in due degree</p>
<p>Grace and good-will their measure have assign&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>The other trine, that with still opening buds</p>
<p>In this eternal springtide blossom fair,</p>
<p>Fearless of bruising from the nightly ram,</p>
<p>Breathe up in warbled melodies threefold</p>
<p>Hosannas blending ever, from the three</p>
<p>Transmitted. hierarchy of gods, for aye</p>
<p>Rejoicing, dominations first, next then</p>
<p>Virtues, and powers the third. The next to whom</p>
<p>Are princedoms and archangels, with glad round</p>
<p>To tread their festal ring; and last the band</p>
<p>Angelical, disporting in their sphere.</p>
<p>All, as they circle in their orders, look</p>
<p>Aloft, and downward with such sway prevail,</p>
<p>That all with mutual impulse tend to God.</p>
<p>These once a mortal view beheld. Desire</p>
<p>In Dionysius so intently wrought,</p>
<p>That he, as I have done rang&rsquo;d them; and nam&rsquo;d</p>
<p>Their orders, marshal&rsquo;d in his thought. From him</p>
<p>Dissentient, one refus&rsquo;d his sacred read.</p>
<p>But soon as in this heav&rsquo;n his doubting eyes</p>
<p>Were open&rsquo;d, Gregory at his error smil&rsquo;d</p>
<p>Nor marvel, that a denizen of earth</p>
<p>Should scan such secret truth; for he had learnt</p>
<p>Both this and much beside of these our orbs,</p>
<p>From an eye-witness to heav&rsquo;n&rsquo;s mysteries.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>No longer than what time Latona&rsquo;s twins</p>
<p>Cover&rsquo;d of Libra and the fleecy star,</p>
<p>Together both, girding the&rsquo; horizon hang,</p>
<p>In even balance from the zenith pois&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>Till from that verge, each, changing hemisphere,</p>
<p>Part the nice level; e&rsquo;en so brief a space</p>
<p>Did Beatrice&rsquo;s silence hold. A smile</p>
<p>Bat painted on her cheek; and her fix&rsquo;d gaze</p>
<p>Bent on the point, at which my vision fail&rsquo;d:</p>
<p>When thus her words resuming she began:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I speak, nor what thou wouldst inquire demand;</p>
<p>For I have mark&rsquo;d it, where all time and place</p>
<p>Are present. Not for increase to himself</p>
<p>Of good, which may not be increas&rsquo;d, but forth</p>
<p>To manifest his glory by its beams,</p>
<p>Inhabiting his own eternity,</p>
<p>Beyond time&rsquo;s limit or what bound soe&rsquo;er</p>
<p>To circumscribe his being, as he will&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>Into new natures, like unto himself,</p>
<p>Eternal Love unfolded. Nor before,</p>
<p>As if in dull inaction torpid lay.</p>
<p>For not in process of before or aft</p>
<p>Upon these waters mov&rsquo;d the Spirit of God.</p>
<p>Simple and mix&rsquo;d, both form and substance, forth</p>
<p>To perfect being started, like three darts</p>
<p>Shot from a bow three-corded. And as ray</p>
<p>In crystal, glass, and amber, shines entire,</p>
<p>E&rsquo;en at the moment of its issuing; thus</p>
<p>Did, from th&rsquo; eternal Sovran, beam entire</p>
<p>His threefold operation, at one act</p>
<p>Produc&rsquo;d coeval. Yet in order each</p>
<p>Created his due station knew: those highest,</p>
<p>Who pure intelligence were made: mere power</p>
<p>The lowest: in the midst, bound with strict league,</p>
<p>Intelligence and power, unsever&rsquo;d bond.</p>
<p>Long tract of ages by the angels past,</p>
<p>Ere the creating of another world,</p>
<p>Describ&rsquo;d on Jerome&rsquo;s pages thou hast seen.</p>
<p>But that what I disclose to thee is true,</p>
<p>Those penmen, whom the Holy Spirit mov&rsquo;d</p>
<p>In many a passage of their sacred book</p>
<p>Attest; as thou by diligent search shalt find</p>
<p>And reason in some sort discerns the same,</p>
<p>Who scarce would grant the heav&rsquo;nly ministers</p>
<p>Of their perfection void, so long a space.</p>
<p>Thus when and where these spirits of love were made,</p>
<p>Thou know&rsquo;st, and how: and knowing hast allay&rsquo;d</p>
<p>Thy thirst, which from the triple question rose.</p>
<p>Ere one had reckon&rsquo;d twenty, e&rsquo;en so soon</p>
<p>Part of the angels fell: and in their fall</p>
<p>Confusion to your elements ensued.</p>
<p>The others kept their station: and this task,</p>
<p>Whereon thou lookst, began with such delight,</p>
<p>That they surcease not ever, day nor night,</p>
<p>Their circling. Of that fatal lapse the cause</p>
<p>Was the curst pride of him, whom thou hast seen</p>
<p>Pent with the world&rsquo;s incumbrance. Those, whom here</p>
<p>Thou seest, were lowly to confess themselves</p>
<p>Of his free bounty, who had made them apt</p>
<p>For ministries so high: therefore their views</p>
<p>Were by enlight&rsquo;ning grace and their own merit</p>
<p>Exalted; so that in their will confirm&rsquo;d</p>
<p>They stand, nor feel to fall. For do not doubt,</p>
<p>But to receive the grace, which heav&rsquo;n vouchsafes,</p>
<p>Is meritorious, even as the soul</p>
<p>With prompt affection welcometh the guest.</p>
<p>Now, without further help, if with good heed</p>
<p>My words thy mind have treasur&rsquo;d, thou henceforth</p>
<p>This consistory round about mayst scan,</p>
<p>And gaze thy fill. But since thou hast on earth</p>
<p>Heard vain disputers, reasoners in the schools,</p>
<p>Canvas the&rsquo; angelic nature, and dispute</p>
<p>Its powers of apprehension, memory, choice;</p>
<p>Therefore, &rsquo;t is well thou take from me the truth,</p>
<p>Pure and without disguise, which they below,</p>
<p>Equivocating, darken and perplex.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Know thou, that, from the first, these substances,</p>
<p>Rejoicing in the countenance of God,</p>
<p>Have held unceasingly their view, intent</p>
<p>Upon the glorious vision, from the which</p>
<p>Naught absent is nor hid: where then no change</p>
<p>Of newness with succession interrupts,</p>
<p>Remembrance there needs none to gather up</p>
<p>Divided thought and images remote</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;So that men, thus at variance with the truth</p>
<p>Dream, though their eyes be open; reckless some</p>
<p>Of error; others well aware they err,</p>
<p>To whom more guilt and shame are justly due.</p>
<p>Each the known track of sage philosophy</p>
<p>Deserts, and has a byway of his own:</p>
<p>So much the restless eagerness to shine</p>
<p>And love of singularity prevail.</p>
<p>Yet this, offensive as it is, provokes</p>
<p>Heav&rsquo;n&rsquo;s anger less, than when the book of God</p>
<p>Is forc&rsquo;d to yield to man&rsquo;s authority,</p>
<p>Or from its straightness warp&rsquo;d: no reck&rsquo;ning made</p>
<p>What blood the sowing of it in the world</p>
<p>Has cost; what favour for himself he wins,</p>
<p>Who meekly clings to it. The aim of all</p>
<p>Is how to shine: e&rsquo;en they, whose office is</p>
<p>To preach the Gospel, let the gospel sleep,</p>
<p>And pass their own inventions off instead.</p>
<p>One tells, how at Christ&rsquo;s suffering the wan moon</p>
<p>Bent back her steps, and shadow&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er the sun</p>
<p>With intervenient disk, as she withdrew:</p>
<p>Another, how the light shrouded itself</p>
<p>Within its tabernacle, and left dark</p>
<p>The Spaniard and the Indian, with the Jew.</p>
<p>Such fables Florence in her pulpit hears,</p>
<p>Bandied about more frequent, than the names</p>
<p>Of Bindi and of Lapi in her streets.</p>
<p>The sheep, meanwhile, poor witless ones, return</p>
<p>From pasture, fed with wind: and what avails</p>
<p>For their excuse, they do not see their harm?</p>
<p>Christ said not to his first conventicle,</p>
<p>&lsquo;Go forth and preach impostures to the world,&rsquo;</p>
<p>But gave them truth to build on; and the sound</p>
<p>Was mighty on their lips; nor needed they,</p>
<p>Beside the gospel, other spear or shield,</p>
<p>To aid them in their warfare for the faith.</p>
<p>The preacher now provides himself with store</p>
<p>Of jests and gibes; and, so there be no lack</p>
<p>Of laughter, while he vents them, his big cowl</p>
<p>Distends, and he has won the meed he sought:</p>
<p>Could but the vulgar catch a glimpse the while</p>
<p>Of that dark bird which nestles in his hood,</p>
<p>They scarce would wait to hear the blessing said.</p>
<p>Which now the dotards hold in such esteem,</p>
<p>That every counterfeit, who spreads abroad</p>
<p>The hands of holy promise, finds a throng</p>
<p>Of credulous fools beneath. Saint Anthony</p>
<p>Fattens with this his swine, and others worse</p>
<p>Than swine, who diet at his lazy board,</p>
<p>Paying with unstamp&rsquo;d metal for their fare.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;But (for we far have wander&rsquo;d) let us seek</p>
<p>The forward path again; so as the way</p>
<p>Be shorten&rsquo;d with the time. No mortal tongue</p>
<p>Nor thought of man hath ever reach&rsquo;d so far,</p>
<p>That of these natures he might count the tribes.</p>
<p>What Daniel of their thousands hath reveal&rsquo;d</p>
<p>With finite number infinite conceals.</p>
<p>The fountain at whose source these drink their beams,</p>
<p>With light supplies them in as many modes,</p>
<p>As there are splendours, that it shines on: each</p>
<p>According to the virtue it conceives,</p>
<p>Differing in love and sweet affection.</p>
<p>Look then how lofty and how huge in breadth</p>
<p>The&rsquo; eternal might, which, broken and dispers&rsquo;d</p>

<p>When from the midmost of this blue abyss</p>
<p>By turns some star is to our vision lost.</p>
<p>And straightway as the handmaid of the sun</p>
<p>Puts forth her radiant brow, all, light by light,</p>

<p>Not merely to exceed our human, but,</p>
<p>That save its Maker, none can to the full</p>
<p>Enjoy it. At this point o&rsquo;erpower&rsquo;d I fail,</p>

<p>Light intellectual replete with love,</p>
<p>Love of true happiness replete with joy,</p>

<p>Here shalt thou look on either mighty host</p>
<p>Of Paradise; and one in that array,</p>
<p>Which in the final judgment thou shalt see.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">As when the lightning, in a sudden spleen</p>

<p>The brief assurance, than I understood</p>
<p>New virtue into me infus&rsquo;d, and sight</p>
<p>Kindled afresh, with vigour to sustain</p>
<p>Excess of light, however pure. I look&rsquo;d;</p>
<p>And in the likeness of a river saw</p>
<p>Light flowing, from whose amber-seeming waves</p>
<p>Flash&rsquo;d up effulgence, as they glided on</p>
<p>&rsquo;Twixt banks, on either side, painted with spring,</p>
<p>Incredible how fair; and, from the tide,</p>
<p>There ever and anon, outstarting, flew</p>
<p>Sparkles instinct with life; and in the flow&rsquo;rs</p>
<p>Did set them, like to rubies chas&rsquo;d in gold;</p>
<p>Then, as if drunk with odors, plung&rsquo;d again</p>
<p>Into the wondrous flood; from which, as one</p>
<p>Re&rsquo;enter&rsquo;d, still another rose. &ldquo;The thirst</p>

<p>But answer found from other than I ween&rsquo;d;</p>
<p>For, Beatrice, when I thought to see,</p>
<p>I saw instead a senior, at my side,</p>
<p> Rob&rsquo;d, as the rest, in glory. Joy benign</p>
<p>Glow&rsquo;d in his eye, and o&rsquo;er his cheek diffus&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>With gestures such as spake a father&rsquo;s love.</p>
<p>And, &ldquo;Whither is she vanish&rsquo;d?&rdquo; straight I ask&rsquo;d.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;By Beatrice summon&rsquo;d,&rdquo; he replied,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I come to aid thy wish. Looking aloft</p>
<p>To the third circle from the highest, there</p>
<p>Behold her on the throne, wherein her merit</p>
<p>Hath plac&rsquo;d her.&rdquo; Answering not, mine eyes I rais&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>And saw her, where aloof she sat, her brow</p>
<p>A wreath reflecting of eternal beams.</p>
<p>Not from the centre of the sea so far</p>
<p>Unto the region of the highest thunder,</p>
<p>As was my ken from hers; and yet the form</p>
<p>Came through that medium down, unmix&rsquo;d and pure,</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;O Lady! thou in whom my hopes have rest!</p>
<p>Who, for my safety, hast not scorn&rsquo;d, in hell</p>
<p>To leave the traces of thy footsteps mark&rsquo;d!</p>
<p>For all mine eyes have seen, I, to thy power</p>
<p>And goodness, virtue owe and grace. Of slave,</p>
<p>Thou hast to freedom brought me; and no means,</p>
<p>For my deliverance apt, hast left untried.</p>
<p>Thy liberal bounty still toward me keep.</p>
<p>That, when my spirit, which thou madest whole,</p>
<p>Is loosen&rsquo;d from this body, it may find</p>
<p>Favour with thee.&rdquo; So I my suit preferr&rsquo;d:</p>
<p>And she, so distant, as appear&rsquo;d, look&rsquo;d down,</p>
<p>And smil&rsquo;d; then tow&rsquo;rds th&rsquo; eternal fountain turn&rsquo;d.</p>
<p class="slindent">And thus the senior, holy and rever&rsquo;d:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That thou at length mayst happily conclude</p>
<p>Thy voyage (to which end I was dispatch&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>By supplication mov&rsquo;d and holy love)</p>
<p>Let thy upsoaring vision range, at large,</p>
<p>This garden through: for so, by ray divine</p>
<p>Kindled, thy ken a higher flight shall mount;</p>
<p>And from heav&rsquo;n&rsquo;s queen, whom fervent I adore,</p>
<p>All gracious aid befriend us; for that I</p>
<p>Am her own faithful Bernard.&rdquo; Like a wight,</p>
<p>Who haply from Croatia wends to see</p>
<p>Our Veronica, and the while &rsquo;t is shown,</p>
<p>Hangs over it with never-sated gaze,</p>
<p>And, all that he hath heard revolving, saith</p>
<p>Unto himself in thought: &ldquo;And didst thou look</p>
<p>E&rsquo;en thus, O Jesus, my true Lord and God?</p>
<p>And was this semblance thine?&rdquo; So gaz&rsquo;d I then</p>
<p>Adoring; for the charity of him,</p>
<p>Who musing, in the world that peace enjoy&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>Stood lively before me. &ldquo;Child of grace!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus he began: &ldquo;thou shalt not knowledge gain</p>
<p>Of this glad being, if thine eyes are held</p>
<p>Still in this depth below. But search around</p>
<p>The circles, to the furthest, till thou spy</p>
<p>Seated in state, the queen, that of this realm</p>
<p>Is sovran.&rdquo; Straight mine eyes I rais&rsquo;d; and bright,</p>
<p>As, at the birth of morn, the eastern clime</p>
<p>Above th&rsquo; horizon, where the sun declines;</p>
<p>To mine eyes, that upward, as from vale</p>
<p>To mountain sped, at th&rsquo; extreme bound, a part</p>
<p>Excell&rsquo;d in lustre all the front oppos&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>And as the glow burns ruddiest o&rsquo;er the wave,</p>
<p>That waits the sloping beam, which Phaeton</p>
<p>Ill knew to guide, and on each part the light</p>
<p>Diminish&rsquo;d fades, intensest in the midst;</p>
<p>So burn&rsquo;d the peaceful oriflamb, and slack&rsquo;d</p>
<p>On every side the living flame decay&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>And in that midst their sportive pennons wav&rsquo;d</p>
<p>Thousands of angels; in resplendence each</p>
<p>Distinct, and quaint adornment. At their glee</p>
<p>And carol, smil&rsquo;d the Lovely One of heav&rsquo;n,</p>
<p>That joy was in the eyes of all the blest.</p>
<p class="slindent">Had I a tongue in eloquence as rich,</p>
<p>As is the colouring in fancy&rsquo;s loom,</p>
<p>&rsquo;T were all too poor to utter the least part</p>
<p>Of that enchantment. When he saw mine eyes</p>
<p>Intent on her, that charm&rsquo;d him, Bernard gaz&rsquo;d</p>
<p>With so exceeding fondness, as infus&rsquo;d</p>
<p>Ardour into my breast, unfelt before.</p>

`<p class="cantohead">Canto XXXII</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>Freely the sage, though wrapt in musings high,</p>
<p>Assum&rsquo;d the teacher&rsquo;s part, and mild began:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wound, that Mary clos&rsquo;d, she open&rsquo;d first,</p>
<p>Who sits so beautiful at Mary&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>The third in order, underneath her, lo!</p>
<p>Rachel with Beatrice. Sarah next,</p>
<p>Judith, Rebecca, and the gleaner maid,</p>
<p>Meek ancestress of him, who sang the songs</p>
<p>Of sore repentance in his sorrowful mood.</p>
<p>All, as I name them, down from deaf to leaf,</p>
<p>Are in gradation throned on the rose.</p>
<p>And from the seventh step, successively,</p>
<p>Adown the breathing tresses of the flow&rsquo;r</p>
<p>Still doth the file of Hebrew dames proceed.</p>
<p>For these are a partition wall, whereby</p>
<p>The sacred stairs are sever&rsquo;d, as the faith</p>
<p>In Christ divides them. On this part, where blooms</p>
<p>Each leaf in full maturity, are set</p>
<p>Such as in Christ, or ere he came, believ&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>On th&rsquo; other, where an intersected space</p>
<p>Yet shows the semicircle void, abide</p>
<p>All they, who look&rsquo;d to Christ already come.</p>
<p>And as our Lady on her glorious stool,</p>
<p>And they who on their stools beneath her sit,</p>
<p>This way distinction make: e&rsquo;en so on his,</p>
<p>The mighty Baptist that way marks the line</p>
<p>(He who endur&rsquo;d the desert and the pains</p>
<p>Of martyrdom, and for two years of hell,</p>
<p>Yet still continued holy), and beneath,</p>
<p>Augustin, Francis, Benedict, and the rest,</p>
<p>Thus far from round to round. So heav&rsquo;n&rsquo;s decree</p>
<p>Forecasts, this garden equally to fill.</p>
<p>With faith in either view, past or to come,</p>
<p>Learn too, that downward from the step, which cleaves</p>
<p>Midway the twain compartments, none there are</p>
<p>Who place obtain for merit of their own,</p>
<p>But have through others&rsquo; merit been advanc&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>On set conditions: spirits all releas&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>Ere for themselves they had the power to choose.</p>
<p>And, if thou mark and listen to them well,</p>
<p>Their childish looks and voice declare as much.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Here, silent as thou art, I know thy doubt;</p>
<p>And gladly will I loose the knot, wherein</p>
<p>Thy subtle thoughts have bound thee. From this realm</p>
<p>Excluded, chalice no entrance here may find,</p>
<p>No more shall hunger, thirst, or sorrow can.</p>
<p>A law immutable hath establish&rsquo;d all;</p>
<p>Nor is there aught thou seest, that doth not fit,</p>
<p>Exactly, as the finger to the ring.</p>
<p>It is not therefore without cause, that these,</p>
<p>O&rsquo;erspeedy comers to immortal life,</p>
<p>Are different in their shares of excellence.</p>
<p>Our Sovran Lord&mdash;that settleth this estate</p>
<p>In love and in delight so absolute,</p>
<p>That wish can dare no further&mdash;every soul,</p>
<p>Created in his joyous sight to dwell,</p>
<p>With grace at pleasure variously endows.</p>
<p>And for a proof th&rsquo; effect may well suffice.</p>
<p>And &rsquo;t is moreover most expressly mark&rsquo;d</p>
<p>In holy scripture, where the twins are said</p>
<p>To, have struggled in the womb. Therefore, as grace</p>
<p>Inweaves the coronet, so every brow</p>
<p>Weareth its proper hue of orient light.</p>
<p>And merely in respect to his prime gift,</p>
<p>Not in reward of meritorious deed,</p>
<p>Hath each his several degree assign&rsquo;d.</p>
<p>In early times with their own innocence</p>
<p>More was not wanting, than the parents&rsquo; faith,</p>
<p>To save them: those first ages past, behoov&rsquo;d</p>
<p>That circumcision in the males should imp</p>
<p>The flight of innocent wings: but since the day</p>
<p>Of grace hath come, without baptismal rites</p>
<p>In Christ accomplish&rsquo;d, innocence herself</p>
<p>Must linger yet below. Now raise thy view</p>
<p>Unto the visage most resembling Christ:</p>
<p>For, in her splendour only, shalt thou win</p>
<p>The pow&rsquo;r to look on him.&rdquo; Forthwith I saw</p>
<p>Such floods of gladness on her visage shower&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>From holy spirits, winging that profound;</p>
<p>That, whatsoever I had yet beheld,</p>
<p>Had not so much suspended me with wonder,</p>
<p>Or shown me such similitude of God.</p>
<p>And he, who had to her descended, once,</p>
<p>On earth, now hail&rsquo;d in heav&rsquo;n; and on pois&rsquo;d wing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ave, Maria, Gratia Plena,&rdquo; sang:</p>
<p>To whose sweet anthem all the blissful court,</p>
<p>From all parts answ&rsquo;ring, rang: that holier joy</p>
<p>Brooded the deep serene. &ldquo;Father rever&rsquo;d:</p>
<p>Who deign&rsquo;st, for me, to quit the pleasant place,</p>
<p>Wherein thou sittest, by eternal lot!</p>
<p>Say, who that angel is, that with such glee</p>
<p>Beholds our queen, and so enamour&rsquo;d glows</p>
<p>Of her high beauty, that all fire he seems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I again resorted to the lore</p>
<p>Of my wise teacher, he, whom Mary&rsquo;s charms</p>
<p>Embellish&rsquo;d, as the sun the morning star;</p>
<p>Who thus in answer spake: &ldquo;In him are summ&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>Whatever of buxomness and free delight</p>
<p>May be in Spirit, or in angel, met:</p>
<p>And so beseems: for that he bare the palm</p>
<p>Down unto Mary, when the Son of God</p>
<p>Vouchsaf&rsquo;d to clothe him in terrestrial weeds.</p>
<p>Now let thine eyes wait heedful on my words,</p>
<p>And note thou of this just and pious realm</p>
<p>The chiefest nobles. Those, highest in bliss,</p>
<p>The twain, on each hand next our empress thron&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>Are as it were two roots unto this rose.</p>
<p>He to the left, the parent, whose rash taste</p>
<p>Proves bitter to his seed; and, on the right,</p>
<p>That ancient father of the holy church,</p>
<p>Into whose keeping Christ did give the keys</p>
<p>Of this sweet flow&rsquo;r: near whom behold the seer,</p>
<p>That, ere he died, saw all the grievous times</p>
<p>Of the fair bride, who with the lance and nails</p>
<p>Was won. And, near unto the other, rests</p>
<p>The leader, under whom on manna fed</p>
<p>Th&rsquo; ungrateful nation, fickle and perverse.</p>
<p>On th&rsquo; other part, facing to Peter, lo!</p>
<p>Where Anna sits, so well content to look</p>
<p>On her lov&rsquo;d daughter, that with moveless eye</p>
<p>She chants the loud hosanna: while, oppos&rsquo;d</p>
<p>To the first father of your mortal kind,</p>
<p>Is Lucia, at whose hest thy lady sped,</p>
<p>When on the edge of ruin clos&rsquo;d thine eye.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;But (for the vision hasteneth so an end)</p>
<p>Here break we off, as the good workman doth,</p>
<p>That shapes the cloak according to the cloth:</p>
<p>And to the primal love our ken shall rise;</p>
<p>That thou mayst penetrate the brightness, far</p>
<p>As sight can bear thee. Yet, alas! in sooth</p>
<p>Beating thy pennons, thinking to advance,</p>
<p>Thou backward fall&rsquo;st. Grace then must first be gain&rsquo;d;</p>
<p>Her grace, whose might can help thee. Thou in prayer</p>
<p>Seek her: and, with affection, whilst I sue,</p>
<p>Attend, and yield me all thy heart.&rdquo; He said,</p>
<p>And thus the saintly orison began.</p>

`<p class="cantohead">Canto XXXIII</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;O virgin mother, daughter of thy Son,</p>
<p>Created beings all in lowliness</p>
<p>Surpassing, as in height, above them all,</p>
<p>Term by th&rsquo; eternal counsel pre-ordain&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>Ennobler of thy nature, so advanc&rsquo;d</p>
<p>In thee, that its great Maker did not scorn,</p>
<p>Himself, in his own work enclos&rsquo;d to dwell!</p>
<p>For in thy womb rekindling shone the love</p>
<p>Reveal&rsquo;d, whose genial influence makes now</p>
<p>This flower to germin in eternal peace!</p>
<p>Here thou to us, of charity and love,</p>
<p>Art, as the noon-day torch: and art, beneath,</p>
<p>To mortal men, of hope a living spring.</p>
<p>So mighty art thou, lady! and so great,</p>
<p>That he who grace desireth, and comes not</p>
<p>To thee for aidance, fain would have desire</p>
<p>Fly without wings. Nor only him who asks,</p>
<p>Thy bounty succours, but doth freely oft</p>
<p>Forerun the asking. Whatsoe&rsquo;er may be</p>
<p>Of excellence in creature, pity mild,</p>
<p>Relenting mercy, large munificence,</p>
<p>Are all combin&rsquo;d in thee. Here kneeleth one,</p>
<p>Who of all spirits hath review&rsquo;d the state,</p>
<p>From the world&rsquo;s lowest gap unto this height.</p>
<p>Suppliant to thee he kneels, imploring grace</p>
<p>For virtue, yet more high to lift his ken</p>
<p>Toward the bliss supreme. And I, who ne&rsquo;er</p>
<p>Coveted sight, more fondly, for myself,</p>
<p>Than now for him, my prayers to thee prefer,</p>
<p>(And pray they be not scant) that thou wouldst drive</p>
<p>Each cloud of his mortality away;</p>
<p>That on the sovran pleasure he may gaze.</p>
<p>This also I entreat of thee, O queen!</p>
<p>Who canst do what thou wilt! that in him thou</p>
<p>Wouldst after all he hath beheld, preserve</p>
<p>Affection sound, and human passions quell.</p>
<p>Lo! Where, with Beatrice, many a saint</p>
<p>Stretch their clasp&rsquo;d hands, in furtherance of my suit!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">The eyes, that heav&rsquo;n with love and awe regards,</p>
<p>Fix&rsquo;d on the suitor, witness&rsquo;d, how benign</p>
<p>She looks on pious pray&rsquo;rs: then fasten&rsquo;d they</p>
<p>On th&rsquo; everlasting light, wherein no eye</p>
<p>Of creature, as may well be thought, so far</p>
<p>Can travel inward. I, meanwhile, who drew</p>
<p>Near to the limit, where all wishes end,</p>
<p>The ardour of my wish (for so behooved),</p>
<p>Ended within me. Beck&rsquo;ning smil&rsquo;d the sage,</p>
<p>That I should look aloft: but, ere he bade,</p>
<p>Already of myself aloft I look&rsquo;d;</p>
<p>For visual strength, refining more and more,</p>
<p>Bare me into the ray authentical</p>
<p>Of sovran light. Thenceforward, what I saw,</p>
<p>Was not for words to speak, nor memory&rsquo;s self</p>
<p>To stand against such outrage on her skill.</p>
<p>As one, who from a dream awaken&rsquo;d, straight,</p>
<p>All he hath seen forgets; yet still retains</p>
<p>Impression of the feeling in his dream;</p>
<p>E&rsquo;en such am I: for all the vision dies,</p>
<p>As &rsquo;t were, away; and yet the sense of sweet,</p>
<p>That sprang from it, still trickles in my heart.</p>
<p>Thus in the sun-thaw is the snow unseal&rsquo;d;</p>
<p>Thus in the winds on flitting leaves was lost</p>
<p>The Sybil&rsquo;s sentence. O eternal beam!</p>
<p>(Whose height what reach of mortal thought may soar?)</p>
<p>Yield me again some little particle</p>
<p>Of what thou then appearedst, give my tongue</p>
<p>Power, but to leave one sparkle of thy glory,</p>
<p>Unto the race to come, that shall not lose</p>
<p>Thy triumph wholly, if thou waken aught</p>
<p>Of memory in me, and endure to hear</p>
<p>The record sound in this unequal strain.</p>
<p class="slindent">Such keenness from the living ray I met,</p>
<p>That, if mine eyes had turn&rsquo;d away, methinks,</p>
<p>I had been lost; but, so embolden&rsquo;d, on</p>
<p>I pass&rsquo;d, as I remember, till my view</p>
<p>Hover&rsquo;d the brink of dread infinitude.</p>
<p class="slindent">O grace! unenvying of thy boon! that gav&rsquo;st</p>
<p>Boldness to fix so earnestly my ken</p>
<p>On th&rsquo; everlasting splendour, that I look&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>While sight was unconsum&rsquo;d, and, in that depth,</p>
<p>Saw in one volume clasp&rsquo;d of love, whatever</p>
<p>The universe unfolds; all properties</p>
<p>Of substance and of accident, beheld,</p>
<p>Compounded, yet one individual light</p>
<p>The whole. And of such bond methinks I saw</p>
<p>The universal form: for that whenever</p>
<p>I do but speak of it, my soul dilates</p>
<p>Beyond her proper self; and, till I speak,</p>
<p>One moment seems a longer lethargy,</p>
<p>Than five-and-twenty ages had appear&rsquo;d</p>
<p>To that emprize, that first made Neptune wonder</p>
<p>At Argo&rsquo;s shadow darkening on his flood.</p>
<p class="slindent">With fixed heed, suspense and motionless,</p>
<p>Wond&rsquo;ring I gaz&rsquo;d; and admiration still</p>
<p>Was kindled, as I gaz&rsquo;d. It may not be,</p>
<p>That one, who looks upon that light, can turn</p>
<p>To other object, willingly, his view.</p>
<p>For all the good, that will may covet, there</p>
<p>Is summ&rsquo;d; and all, elsewhere defective found,</p>
<p>Complete. My tongue shall utter now, no more</p>
<p>E&rsquo;en what remembrance keeps, than could the babe&rsquo;s</p>
<p>That yet is moisten&rsquo;d at his mother&rsquo;s breast.</p>
<p>Not that the semblance of the living light</p>
<p>Was chang&rsquo;d (that ever as at first remain&rsquo;d)</p>
<p>But that my vision quickening, in that sole</p>
<p>Appearance, still new miracles descry&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>And toil&rsquo;d me with the change. In that abyss</p>
<p>Of radiance, clear and lofty, seem&rsquo;d methought,</p>
<p>Three orbs of triple hue clipt in one bound:</p>
<p>And, from another, one reflected seem&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>As rainbow is from rainbow: and the third</p>
<p>Seem&rsquo;d fire, breath&rsquo;d equally from both. Oh speech</p>
<p>How feeble and how faint art thou, to give</p>
<p>Conception birth! Yet this to what I saw</p>
<p>Is less than little. Oh eternal light!</p>
<p>Sole in thyself that dwellst; and of thyself</p>
<p>Sole understood, past, present, or to come!</p>
<p>Thou smiledst; on that circling, which in thee</p>
<p>Seem&rsquo;d as reflected splendour, while I mus&rsquo;d;</p>
<p>For I therein, methought, in its own hue</p>
<p>Beheld our image painted: steadfastly</p>
<p>I therefore por&rsquo;d upon the view. As one</p>
<p>Who vers&rsquo;d in geometric lore, would fain</p>
<p>Measure the circle; and, though pondering long</p>
<p>And deeply, that beginning, which he needs,</p>
<p>Finds not; e&rsquo;en such was I, intent to scan</p>
<p>The novel wonder, and trace out the form,</p>
<p>How to the circle fitted, and therein</p>
<p>How plac&rsquo;d: but the flight was not for my wing;</p>
<p>Had not a flash darted athwart my mind,</p>
<p>And in the spleen unfolded what it sought.</p>
<p class="slindent">Here vigour fail&rsquo;d the tow&rsquo;ring fantasy:</p>
<p>But yet the will roll&rsquo;d onward, like a wheel</p>
<p>In even motion, by the Love impell&rsquo;d,</p>
<p>That moves the sun in heav&rsquo;n and all the stars.</p>
