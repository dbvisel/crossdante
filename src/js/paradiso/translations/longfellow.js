`<p class="cantohead">Paradise: Canto I</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>The glory of Him who moveth everything</p>
<p class="slindent">Doth penetrate the universe, and shine</p>
<p class="slindent">In one part more and in another less.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Within that heaven which most his light receives</p>
<p class="slindent">Was I, and things beheld which to repeat</p>
<p class="slindent">Nor knows, nor can, who from above descends;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Because in drawing near to its desire</p>
<p class="slindent">Our intellect ingulphs itself so far,</p>
<p class="slindent">That after it the memory cannot go.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Truly whatever of the holy realm</p>
<p class="slindent">I had the power to treasure in my mind</p>
<p class="slindent">Shall now become the subject of my song.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>O good Apollo, for this last emprise</p>
<p class="slindent">Make of me such a vessel of thy power</p>
<p class="slindent">As giving the beloved laurel asks!</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>One summit of Parnassus hitherto</p>
<p class="slindent">Has been enough for me, but now with both</p>
<p class="slindent">I needs must enter the arena left.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Enter into my bosom, thou, and breathe</p>
<p class="slindent">As at the time when Marsyas thou didst draw</p>
<p class="slindent">Out of the scabbard of those limbs of his.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>O power divine, lend&rsquo;st thou thyself to me</p>
<p class="slindent">So that the shadow of the blessed realm</p>
<p class="slindent">Stamped in my brain I can make manifest,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thou&rsquo;lt see me come unto thy darling tree,</p>
<p class="slindent">And crown myself thereafter with those leaves</p>
<p class="slindent">Of which the theme and thou shall make me worthy.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So seldom, Father, do we gather them</p>
<p class="slindent">For triumph or of Caesar or of Poet,</p>
<p class="slindent">(The fault and shame of human inclinations,)</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>That the Peneian foliage should bring forth</p>
<p class="slindent">Joy to the joyous Delphic deity,</p>
<p class="slindent">When any one it makes to thirst for it.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>A little spark is followed by great flame;</p>
<p class="slindent">Perchance with better voices after me</p>
<p class="slindent">Shall prayer be made that Cyrrha may respond!</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>To mortal men by passages diverse</p>
<p class="slindent">Uprises the world&rsquo;s lamp; but by that one</p>
<p class="slindent">Which circles four uniteth with three crosses,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>With better course and with a better star</p>
<p class="slindent">Conjoined it issues, and the mundane wax</p>
<p class="slindent">Tempers and stamps more after its own fashion.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Almost that passage had made morning there</p>
<p class="slindent">And evening here, and there was wholly white</p>
<p class="slindent">That hemisphere, and black the other part,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>When Beatrice towards the left-hand side</p>
<p class="slindent">I saw turned round, and gazing at the sun;</p>
<p class="slindent">Never did eagle fasten so upon it!</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And even as a second ray is wont</p>
<p class="slindent">To issue from the first and reascend,</p>
<p class="slindent">Like to a pilgrim who would fain return,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thus of her action, through the eyes infused</p>
<p class="slindent">In my imagination, mine I made,</p>
<p class="slindent">And sunward fixed mine eyes beyond our wont.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>There much is lawful which is here unlawful</p>
<p class="slindent">Unto our powers, by virtue of the place</p>
<p class="slindent">Made for the human species as its own.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Not long I bore it, nor so little while</p>
<p class="slindent">But I beheld it sparkle round about</p>
<p class="slindent">Like iron that comes molten from the fire;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And suddenly it seemed that day to day</p>
<p class="slindent">Was added, as if He who has the power</p>
<p class="slindent">Had with another sun the heaven adorned.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>With eyes upon the everlasting wheels</p>
<p class="slindent">Stood Beatrice all intent, and I, on her</p>
<p class="slindent">Fixing my vision from above removed,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Such at her aspect inwardly became</p>
<p class="slindent">As Glaucus, tasting of the herb that made him</p>
<p class="slindent">Peer of the other gods beneath the sea.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>To represent transhumanise in words</p>
<p class="slindent">Impossible were; the example, then, suffice</p>
<p class="slindent">Him for whom Grace the experience reserves.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>If I was merely what of me thou newly</p>
<p class="slindent">Createdst, Love who governest the heaven,</p>
<p class="slindent">Thou knowest, who didst lift me with thy light!</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>When now the wheel, which thou dost make eternal</p>
<p class="slindent">Desiring thee, made me attentive to it</p>
<p class="slindent">By harmony thou dost modulate and measure,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then seemed to me so much of heaven enkindled</p>
<p class="slindent">By the sun&rsquo;s flame, that neither rain nor river</p>
<p class="slindent">E&rsquo;er made a lake so widely spread abroad.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The newness of the sound and the great light</p>
<p class="slindent">Kindled in me a longing for their cause,</p>
<p class="slindent">Never before with such acuteness felt;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Whence she, who saw me as I saw myself,</p>
<p class="slindent">To quiet in me my perturbed mind,</p>
<p class="slindent">Opened her mouth, ere I did mine to ask,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And she began: &ldquo;Thou makest thyself so dull</p>
<p class="slindent">With false imagining, that thou seest not</p>
<p class="slindent">What thou wouldst see if thou hadst shaken it off.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thou art not upon earth, as thou believest;</p>
<p class="slindent">But lightning, fleeing its appropriate site,</p>
<p class="slindent">Ne&rsquo;er ran as thou, who thitherward returnest.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>If of my former doubt I was divested</p>
<p class="slindent">By these brief little words more smiled than spoken,</p>
<p class="slindent">I in a new one was the more ensnared;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And said: &ldquo;Already did I rest content</p>
<p class="slindent">From great amazement; but am now amazed</p>
<p class="slindent">In what way I transcend these bodies light.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Whereupon she, after a pitying sigh,</p>
<p class="slindent">Her eyes directed tow&rsquo;rds me with that look</p>
<p class="slindent">A mother casts on a delirious child;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And she began: &ldquo;All things whate&rsquo;er they be</p>
<p class="slindent">Have order among themselves, and this is form,</p>
<p class="slindent">That makes the universe resemble God.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Here do the higher creatures see the footprints</p>
<p class="slindent">Of the Eternal Power, which is the end</p>
<p class="slindent">Whereto is made the law already mentioned.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>In the order that I speak of are inclined</p>
<p class="slindent">All natures, by their destinies diverse,</p>
<p class="slindent">More or less near unto their origin;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Hence they move onward unto ports diverse</p>
<p class="slindent">O&rsquo;er the great sea of being; and each one</p>
<p class="slindent">With instinct given it which bears it on.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>This bears away the fire towards the moon;</p>
<p class="slindent">This is in mortal hearts the motive power</p>
<p class="slindent">This binds together and unites the earth.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Nor only the created things that are</p>
<p class="slindent">Without intelligence this bow shoots forth,</p>
<p class="slindent">But those that have both intellect and love.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The Providence that regulates all this</p>
<p class="slindent">Makes with its light the heaven forever quiet,</p>
<p class="slindent">Wherein that turns which has the greatest haste.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And thither now, as to a site decreed,</p>
<p class="slindent">Bears us away the virtue of that cord</p>
<p class="slindent">Which aims its arrows at a joyous mark.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>True is it, that as oftentimes the form</p>
<p class="slindent">Accords not with the intention of the art,</p>
<p class="slindent">Because in answering is matter deaf,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So likewise from this course doth deviate</p>
<p class="slindent">Sometimes the creature, who the power possesses,</p>
<p class="slindent">Though thus impelled, to swerve some other way,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>(In the same wise as one may see the fire</p>
<p class="slindent">Fall from a cloud,) if the first impetus</p>
<p class="slindent">Earthward is wrested by some false delight.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thou shouldst not wonder more, if well I judge,</p>
<p class="slindent">At thine ascent, than at a rivulet</p>
<p class="slindent">From some high mount descending to the lowland.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Marvel it would be in thee, if deprived</p>
<p class="slindent">Of hindrance, thou wert seated down below,</p>
<p class="slindent">As if on earth the living fire were quiet.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thereat she heavenward turned again her face.</p></div>`,

`<p class="cantohead">Paradiso: Canto II</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>O Ye, who in some pretty little boat,</p>
<p class="slindent">Eager to listen, have been following</p>
<p class="slindent">Behind my ship, that singing sails along,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Turn back to look again upon your shores;</p>
<p class="slindent">Do not put out to sea, lest peradventure,</p>
<p class="slindent">In losing me, you might yourselves be lost.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The sea I sail has never yet been passed;</p>
<p class="slindent">Minerva breathes, and pilots me Apollo,</p>
<p class="slindent">And Muses nine point out to me the Bears.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Ye other few who have the neck uplifted</p>
<p class="slindent">Betimes to th&rsquo; bread of Angels upon which</p>
<p class="slindent">One liveth here and grows not sated by it,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Well may you launch upon the deep salt-sea</p>
<p class="slindent">Your vessel, keeping still my wake before you</p>
<p class="slindent">Upon the water that grows smooth again.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Those glorious ones who unto Colchos passed</p>
<p class="slindent">Were not so wonder-struck as you shall be,</p>
<p class="slindent">When Jason they beheld a ploughman made!</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The con-created and perpetual thirst</p>
<p class="slindent">For the realm deiform did bear us on,</p>
<p class="slindent">As swift almost as ye the heavens behold.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Upward gazed Beatrice, and I at her;</p>
<p class="slindent">And in such space perchance as strikes a bolt</p>
<p class="slindent">And flies, and from the notch unlocks itself,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Arrived I saw me where a wondrous thing</p>
<p class="slindent">Drew to itself my sight; and therefore she</p>
<p class="slindent">From whom no care of mine could be concealed,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Towards me turning, blithe as beautiful,</p>
<p class="slindent">Said unto me: &ldquo;Fix gratefully thy mind</p>
<p class="slindent">On God, who unto the first star has brought us.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>It seemed to me a cloud encompassed us,</p>
<p class="slindent">Luminous, dense, consolidate and bright</p>
<p class="slindent">As adamant on which the sun is striking.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Into itself did the eternal pearl</p>
<p class="slindent">Receive us, even as water doth receive</p>
<p class="slindent">A ray of light, remaining still unbroken.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>If I was body, (and we here conceive not</p>
<p class="slindent">How one dimension tolerates another,</p>
<p class="slindent">Which needs must be if body enter body,)</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>More the desire should be enkindled in us</p>
<p class="slindent">That essence to behold, wherein is seen</p>
<p class="slindent">How God and our own nature were united.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>There will be seen what we receive by faith,</p>
<p class="slindent">Not demonstrated, but self-evident</p>
<p class="slindent">In guise of the first truth that man believes.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I made reply: &ldquo;Madonna, as devoutly</p>
<p class="slindent">As most I can do I give thanks to Him</p>
<p class="slindent">Who has removed me from the mortal world.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But tell me what the dusky spots may be</p>
<p class="slindent">Upon this body, which below on earth</p>
<p class="slindent">Make people tell that fabulous tale of Cain?&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Somewhat she smiled; and then, &ldquo;If the opinion</p>
<p class="slindent">Of mortals be erroneous,&rdquo; she said,</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Where&rsquo;er the key of sense doth not unlock,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Certes, the shafts of wonder should not pierce thee</p>
<p class="slindent">Now, forasmuch as, following the senses,</p>
<p class="slindent">Thou seest that the reason has short wings.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But tell me what thou think&rsquo;st of it thyself.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">And I: &ldquo;What seems to us up here diverse,</p>
<p class="slindent">Is caused, I think, by bodies rare and dense.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And she: &ldquo;Right truly shalt thou see immersed</p>
<p class="slindent">In error thy belief, if well thou hearest</p>
<p class="slindent">The argument that I shall make against it.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Lights many the eighth sphere displays to you</p>
<p class="slindent">Which in their quality and quantity</p>
<p class="slindent">May noted be of aspects different.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>If this were caused by rare and dense alone,</p>
<p class="slindent">One only virtue would there be in all</p>
<p class="slindent">Or more or less diffused, or equally.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Virtues diverse must be perforce the fruits</p>
<p class="slindent">Of formal principles; and these, save one,</p>
<p class="slindent">Of course would by thy reasoning be destroyed.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Besides, if rarity were of this dimness</p>
<p class="slindent">The cause thou askest, either through and through</p>
<p class="slindent">This planet thus attenuate were of matter,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Or else, as in a body is apportioned</p>
<p class="slindent">The fat and lean, so in like manner this</p>
<p class="slindent">Would in its volume interchange the leaves.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Were it the former, in the sun&rsquo;s eclipse</p>
<p class="slindent">It would be manifest by the shining through</p>
<p class="slindent">Of light, as through aught tenuous interfused.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>This is not so; hence we must scan the other,</p>
<p class="slindent">And if it chance the other I demolish,</p>
<p class="slindent">Then falsified will thy opinion be.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But if this rarity go not through and through,</p>
<p class="slindent">There needs must be a limit, beyond which</p>
<p class="slindent">Its contrary prevents the further passing,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And thence the foreign radiance is reflected,</p>
<p class="slindent">Even as a colour cometh back from glass,</p>
<p class="slindent">The which behind itself concealeth lead.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Now thou wilt say the sunbeam shows itself</p>
<p class="slindent">More dimly there than in the other parts,</p>
<p class="slindent">By being there reflected farther back.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>From this reply experiment will free thee</p>
<p class="slindent">If e&rsquo;er thou try it, which is wont to be</p>
<p class="slindent">The fountain to the rivers of your arts.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Three mirrors shalt thou take, and two remove</p>
<p class="slindent">Alike from thee, the other more remote</p>
<p class="slindent">Between the former two shall meet thine eyes.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Turned towards these, cause that behind thy back</p>
<p class="slindent">Be placed a light, illuming the three mirrors</p>
<p class="slindent">And coming back to thee by all reflected.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Though in its quantity be not so ample</p>
<p class="slindent">The image most remote, there shalt thou see</p>
<p class="slindent">How it perforce is equally resplendent.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Now, as beneath the touches of warm rays</p>
<p class="slindent">Naked the subject of the snow remains</p>
<p class="slindent">Both of its former colour and its cold,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thee thus remaining in thy intellect,</p>
<p class="slindent">Will I inform with such a living light,</p>
<p class="slindent">That it shall tremble in its aspect to thee.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Within the heaven of the divine repose</p>
<p class="slindent">Revolves a body, in whose virtue lies</p>
<p class="slindent">The being of whatever it contains.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The following heaven, that has so many eyes,</p>
<p class="slindent">Divides this being by essences diverse,</p>
<p class="slindent">Distinguished from it, and by it contained.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The other spheres, by various differences,</p>
<p class="slindent">All the distinctions which they have within them</p>
<p class="slindent">Dispose unto their ends and their effects.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thus do these organs of the world proceed,</p>
<p class="slindent">As thou perceivest now, from grade to grade;</p>
<p class="slindent">Since from above they take, and act beneath.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Observe me well, how through this place I come</p>
<p class="slindent">Unto the truth thou wishest, that hereafter</p>
<p class="slindent">Thou mayst alone know how to keep the ford</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The power and motion of the holy spheres,</p>
<p class="slindent">As from the artisan the hammer&rsquo;s craft,</p>
<p class="slindent">Forth from the blessed motors must proceed.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The heaven, which lights so manifold make fair,</p>
<p class="slindent">From the Intelligence profound, which turns it,</p>
<p class="slindent">The image takes, and makes of it a seal.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And even as the soul within your dust</p>
<p class="slindent">Through members different and accommodated</p>
<p class="slindent">To faculties diverse expands itself,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So likewise this Intelligence diffuses</p>
<p class="slindent">Its virtue multiplied among the stars.</p>
<p class="slindent">Itself revolving on its unity.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Virtue diverse doth a diverse alloyage</p>
<p class="slindent">Make with the precious body that it quickens,</p>
<p class="slindent">In which, as life in you, it is combined.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>From the glad nature whence it is derived,</p>
<p class="slindent">The mingled virtue through the body shines,</p>
<p class="slindent">Even as gladness through the living pupil.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>From this proceeds whate&rsquo;er from light to light</p>
<p class="slindent">Appeareth different, not from dense and rare:</p>
<p class="slindent">This is the formal principle that produces,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>According to its goodness, dark and bright.&rdquo;</p></div>`,

`<p class="cantohead">Paradiso: Canto III</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>That Sun, which erst with love my bosom warmed,</p>
<p class="slindent">Of beauteous truth had unto me discovered,</p>
<p class="slindent">By proving and reproving, the sweet aspect.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And, that I might confess myself convinced</p>
<p class="slindent">And confident, so far as was befitting,</p>
<p class="slindent">I lifted more erect my head to speak.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But there appeared a vision, which withdrew me</p>
<p class="slindent">So close to it, in order to be seen,</p>
<p class="slindent">That my confession I remembered not.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Such as through polished and transparent glass,</p>
<p class="slindent">Or waters crystalline and undisturbed,</p>
<p class="slindent">But not so deep as that their bed be lost,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Come back again the outlines of our faces</p>
<p class="slindent">So feeble, that a pearl on forehead white</p>
<p class="slindent">Comes not less speedily unto our eyes;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Such saw I many faces prompt to speak,</p>
<p class="slindent">So that I ran in error opposite</p>
<p class="slindent">To that which kindled love &rsquo;twixt man and fountain.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>As soon as I became aware of them,</p>
<p class="slindent">Esteeming them as mirrored semblances,</p>
<p class="slindent">To see of whom they were, mine eyes I turned,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And nothing saw, and once more turned them forward</p>
<p class="slindent">Direct into the light of my sweet Guide,</p>
<p class="slindent">Who smiling kindled in her holy eyes.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Marvel thou not,&rdquo; she said to me, &ldquo;because</p>
<p class="slindent">I smile at this thy puerile conceit,</p>
<p class="slindent">Since on the truth it trusts not yet its foot,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But turns thee, as &rsquo;tis wont, on emptiness.</p>
<p class="slindent">True substances are these which thou beholdest,</p>
<p class="slindent">Here relegate for breaking of some vow.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Therefore speak with them, listen and believe;</p>
<p class="slindent">For the true light, which giveth peace to them,</p>
<p class="slindent">Permits them not to turn from it their feet.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And I unto the shade that seemed most wishful</p>
<p class="slindent">To speak directed me, and I began,</p>
<p class="slindent">As one whom too great eagerness bewilders:</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;O well-created spirit, who in the rays</p>
<p class="slindent">Of life eternal dost the sweetness taste</p>
<p class="slindent">Which being untasted ne&rsquo;er is comprehended,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Grateful &rsquo;twill be to me, if thou content me</p>
<p class="slindent">Both with thy name and with your destiny.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Whereat she promptly and with laughing eyes:</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Our charity doth never shut the doors</p>
<p class="slindent">Against a just desire, except as one</p>
<p class="slindent">Who wills that all her court be like herself.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I was a virgin sister in the world;</p>
<p class="slindent">And if thy mind doth contemplate me well,</p>
<p class="slindent">The being more fair will not conceal me from thee,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But thou shalt recognise I am Piccarda,</p>
<p class="slindent">Who, stationed here among these other blessed,</p>
<p class="slindent">Myself am blessed in the slowest sphere.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>All our affections, that alone inflamed</p>
<p class="slindent">Are in the pleasure of the Holy Ghost,</p>
<p class="slindent">Rejoice at being of his order formed;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And this allotment, which appears so low,</p>
<p class="slindent">Therefore is given us, because our vows</p>
<p class="slindent">Have been neglected and in some part void.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Whence I to her: &ldquo;In your miraculous aspects</p>
<p class="slindent">There shines I know not what of the divine,</p>
<p class="slindent">Which doth transform you from our first conceptions.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Therefore I was not swift in my remembrance;</p>
<p class="slindent">But what thou tellest me now aids me so,</p>
<p class="slindent">That the refiguring is easier to me.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But tell me, ye who in this place are happy,</p>
<p class="slindent">Are you desirous of a higher place,</p>
<p class="slindent">To see more or to make yourselves more friends?&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>First with those other shades she smiled a little;</p>
<p class="slindent">Thereafter answered me so full of gladness,</p>
<p class="slindent">She seemed to burn in the first fire of love:</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Brother, our will is quieted by virtue</p>
<p class="slindent">Of charity, that makes us wish alone</p>
<p class="slindent">For what we have, nor gives us thirst for more.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>If to be more exalted we aspired,</p>
<p class="slindent">Discordant would our aspirations be</p>
<p class="slindent">Unto the will of Him who here secludes us;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Which thou shalt see finds no place in these circles,</p>
<p class="slindent">If being in charity is needful here,</p>
<p class="slindent">And if thou lookest well into its nature;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Nay, &rsquo;tis essential to this blest existence</p>
<p class="slindent">To keep itself within the will divine,</p>
<p class="slindent">Whereby our very wishes are made one;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So that, as we are station above station</p>
<p class="slindent">Throughout this realm, to all the realm &rsquo;tis pleasing,</p>
<p class="slindent">As to the King, who makes his will our will.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And his will is our peace; this is the sea</p>
<p class="slindent">To which is moving onward whatsoever</p>
<p class="slindent">It doth create, and all that nature makes.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then it was clear to me how everywhere</p>
<p class="slindent">In heaven is Paradise, although the grace</p>
<p class="slindent">Of good supreme there rain not in one measure.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But as it comes to pass, if one food sates,</p>
<p class="slindent">And for another still remains the longing,</p>
<p class="slindent">We ask for this, and that decline with thanks,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>E&rsquo;en thus did I; with gesture and with word,</p>
<p class="slindent">To learn from her what was the web wherein</p>
<p class="slindent">She did not ply the shuttle to the end.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;A perfect life and merit high in-heaven</p>
<p class="slindent">A lady o&rsquo;er us,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;by whose rule</p>
<p class="slindent">Down in your world they vest and veil themselves,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>That until death they may both watch and sleep</p>
<p class="slindent">Beside that Spouse who every vow accepts</p>
<p class="slindent">Which charity conformeth to his pleasure.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>To follow her, in girlhood from the world</p>
<p class="slindent">I fled, and in her habit shut myself,</p>
<p class="slindent">And pledged me to the pathway of her sect.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then men accustomed unto evil more</p>
<p class="slindent">Than unto good, from the sweet cloister tore me;</p>
<p class="slindent">God knows what afterward my life became.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>This other splendour, which to thee reveals</p>
<p class="slindent">Itself on my right side, and is enkindled</p>
<p class="slindent">With all the illumination of our sphere,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>What of myself I say applies to her;</p>
<p class="slindent">A nun was she, and likewise from her head</p>
<p class="slindent">Was ta&rsquo;en the shadow of the sacred wimple.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But when she too was to the world returned</p>
<p class="slindent">Against her wishes and against good usage,</p>
<p class="slindent">Of the heart&rsquo;s veil she never was divested.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Of great Costanza this is the effulgence,</p>
<p class="slindent">Who from the second wind of Suabia</p>
<p class="slindent">Brought forth the third and latest puissance.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thus unto me she spake, and then began</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Ave Maria&rdquo; singing, and in singing</p>
<p class="slindent">Vanished, as through deep water something heavy.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>My sight, that followed her as long a time</p>
<p class="slindent">As it was possible, when it had lost her</p>
<p class="slindent">Turned round unto the mark of more desire,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And wholly unto Beatrice reverted;</p>
<p class="slindent">But she such lightnings flashed into mine eyes,</p>
<p class="slindent">That at the first my sight endured it not;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And this in questioning more backward made me.</p></div>`,

`<p class="cantohead">Paradiso: Canto IV</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>Between two viands, equally removed</p>

<p class="slindent">Ere either he could bring unto his teeth.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So would a lamb between the ravenings</p>
<p class="slindent">Of two fierce wolves stand fearing both alike;</p>
<p class="slindent">And so would stand a dog between two does.</p></div>

<p class="slindent">More fervent far than by articulate speech.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Again for doubting furnish thee occasion</p>
<p class="slindent">Souls seeming to return unto the stars,</p>
<p class="slindent">According to the sentiment of Plato.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>These are the questions which upon thy wish</p>
<p class="slindent">Are thrusting equally; and therefore first</p>
<p class="slindent">Will I treat that which hath the most of gall.</p></div>

<p class="slindent">And have sweet life in different degrees,</p>
<p class="slindent">By feeling more or less the eternal breath.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>They showed themselves here, not because allotted</p>
<p class="slindent">This sphere has been to them, but to give sign</p>
<p class="slindent">Of the celestial which is least exalted.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>To speak thus is adapted to your mind,</p>
<p class="slindent">Since only through the sense it apprehendeth</p>
<p class="slindent">What then it worthy makes of intellect.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>On this account the Scripture condescends</p>
<p class="slindent">Unto your faculties, and feet and hands</p>

<p class="slindent">Gabriel and Michael represent to you,</p>
<p class="slindent">And him who made Tobias whole again.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>That which Timaeus argues of the soul</p>
<p class="slindent">Doth not resemble that which here is seen,</p>
<p class="slindent">Because it seems that as he speaks he thinks.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>He says the soul unto its star returns,</p>
<p class="slindent">Believing it to have been severed thence</p>
<p class="slindent">Whenever nature gave it as a form.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Perhaps his doctrine is of other guise</p>
<p class="slindent">Than the words sound, and possibly may be</p>
<p class="slindent">With meaning that is not to be derided.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>If he doth mean that to these wheels return</p>
<p class="slindent">The honour of their influence and the blame,</p>
<p class="slindent">Perhaps his bow doth hit upon some truth.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>This principle ill understood once warped</p>
<p class="slindent">The whole world nearly, till it went astray</p>
<p class="slindent">Invoking Jove and Mercury and Mars.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The other doubt which doth disquiet thee</p>
<p class="slindent">Less venom has, for its malevolence</p>
<p class="slindent">Could never lead thee otherwhere from me.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>That as unjust our justice should appear</p>
<p class="slindent">In eyes of mortals, is an argument</p>
<p class="slindent">Of faith, and not of sin heretical.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But still, that your perception may be able</p>
<p class="slindent">To thoroughly penetrate this verity,</p>
<p class="slindent">As thou desirest, I will satisfy thee.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>If it be violence when he who suffers</p>
<p class="slindent">Co-operates not with him who uses force,</p>
<p class="slindent">These souls were not on that account excused;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>For will is never quenched unless it will,</p>
<p class="slindent">But operates as nature doth in fire</p>
<p class="slindent">If violence a thousand times distort it.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Hence, if it yieldeth more or less, it seconds</p>
<p class="slindent">The force; and these have done so, having power</p>
<p class="slindent">Of turning back unto the holy place.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>If their will had been perfect, like to that</p>
<p class="slindent">Which Lawrence fast upon his gridiron held,</p>
<p class="slindent">And Mutius made severe to his own hand,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>It would have urged them back along the road</p>
<p class="slindent">Whence they were dragged, as soon as they were free;</p>
<p class="slindent">But such a solid will is all too rare.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And by these words, if thou hast gathered them</p>
<p class="slindent">As thou shouldst do, the argument is refuted</p>
<p class="slindent">That would have still annoyed thee many times.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But now another passage runs across</p>
<p class="slindent">Before thine eyes, and such that by thyself</p>
<p class="slindent">Thou couldst not thread it ere thou wouldst be weary.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I have for certain put into thy mind</p>
<p class="slindent">That soul beatified could never lie,</p>
<p class="slindent">For it is near the primal Truth,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And then thou from Piccarda might&rsquo;st have heard</p>
<p class="slindent">Costanza kept affection for the veil,</p>
<p class="slindent">So that she seemeth here to contradict me.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Many times, brother, has it come to pass,</p>
<p class="slindent">That, to escape from peril, with reluctance</p>
<p class="slindent">That has been done it was not right to do,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>E&rsquo;en as Alcmaeon (who, being by his father</p>
<p class="slindent">Thereto entreated, his own mother slew)</p>
<p class="slindent">Not to lose pity pitiless became.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>At this point I desire thee to remember</p>
<p class="slindent">That force with will commingles, and they cause</p>
<p class="slindent">That the offences cannot be excused.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Will absolute consenteth not to evil;</p>
<p class="slindent">But in so far consenteth as it fears,</p>
<p class="slindent">If it refrain, to fall into more harm.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Hence when Piccarda uses this expression,</p>
<p class="slindent">She meaneth the will absolute, and I</p>
<p class="slindent">The other, so that both of us speak truth.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Such was the flowing of the holy river</p>
<p class="slindent">That issued from the fount whence springs all truth;</p>
<p class="slindent">This put to rest my wishes one and all.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;O love of the first lover, O divine,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Said I forthwith, &ldquo;whose speech inundates me</p>
<p class="slindent">And warms me so, it more and more revives me,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>My own affection is not so profound</p>
<p class="slindent">As to suffice in rendering grace for grace;</p>
<p class="slindent">Let Him, who sees and can, thereto respond.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Well I perceive that never sated is</p>
<p class="slindent">Our intellect unless the Truth illume it,</p>
<p class="slindent">Beyond which nothing true expands itself.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>It rests therein, as wild beast in his lair,</p>
<p class="slindent">When it attains it; and it can attain it;</p>
<p class="slindent">If not, then each desire would frustrate be.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Therefore springs up, in fashion of a shoot,</p>
<p class="slindent">Doubt at the foot of truth; and this is nature,</p>
<p class="slindent">Which to the top from height to height impels us.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>This doth invite me, this assurance give me</p>
<p class="slindent">With reverence, Lady, to inquire of you</p>
<p class="slindent">Another truth, which is obscure to me.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I wish to know if man can satisfy you</p>
<p class="slindent">For broken vows with other good deeds, so</p>
<p class="slindent">That in your balance they will not be light.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Beatrice gazed upon me with her eyes</p>
<p class="slindent">Full of the sparks of love, and so divine,</p>
<p class="slindent">That, overcome my power, I turned my back</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And almost lost myself with eyes downcast.</p></div>`,

`<p class="cantohead">Paradiso: Canto V</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;If in the heat of love I flame upon thee</p>
<p class="slindent">Beyond the measure that on earth is seen,</p>
<p class="slindent">So that the valour of thine eyes I vanquish,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Marvel thou not thereat; for this proceeds</p>
<p class="slindent">From perfect sight, which as it apprehends</p>
<p class="slindent">To the good apprehended moves its feet.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Well I perceive how is already shining</p>
<p class="slindent">Into thine intellect the eternal light,</p>
<p class="slindent">That only seen enkindles always love;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And if some other thing your love seduce,</p>
<p class="slindent">&rsquo;Tis nothing but a vestige of the same,</p>
<p class="slindent">Ill understood, which there is shining through.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thou fain wouldst know if with another service</p>
<p class="slindent">For broken vow can such return be made</p>
<p class="slindent">As to secure the soul from further claim.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>This Canto thus did Beatrice begin;</p>
<p class="slindent">And, as a man who breaks not off his speech,</p>
<p class="slindent">Continued thus her holy argument:</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;The greatest gift that in his largess God</p>
<p class="slindent">Creating made, and unto his own goodness</p>
<p class="slindent">Nearest conformed, and that which he doth prize</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Most highly, is the freedom of the will,</p>
<p class="slindent">Wherewith the creatures of intelligence</p>
<p class="slindent">Both all and only were and are endowed.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Now wilt thou see, if thence thou reasonest,</p>
<p class="slindent">The high worth of a vow, if it he made</p>
<p class="slindent">So that when thou consentest God consents:</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>For, closing between God and man the compact,</p>
<p class="slindent">A sacrifice is of this treasure made,</p>
<p class="slindent">Such as I say, and made by its own act.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>What can be rendered then as compensation?</p>
<p class="slindent">Think&rsquo;st thou to make good use of what thou&rsquo;st offered,</p>
<p class="slindent">With gains ill gotten thou wouldst do good deed.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Now art thou certain of the greater point;</p>
<p class="slindent">But because Holy Church in this dispenses,</p>
<p class="slindent">Which seems against the truth which I have shown thee,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Behoves thee still to sit awhile at table,</p>
<p class="slindent">Because the solid food which thou hast taken</p>
<p class="slindent">Requireth further aid for thy digestion.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Open thy mind to that which I reveal,</p>
<p class="slindent">And fix it there within; for &rsquo;tis not knowledge,</p>
<p class="slindent">The having heard without retaining it.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>In the essence of this sacrifice two things</p>
<p class="slindent">Convene together; and the one is that</p>
<p class="slindent">Of which &rsquo;tis made, the other is the agreement.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>This last for evermore is cancelled not</p>
<p class="slindent">Unless complied with, and concerning this</p>
<p class="slindent">With such precision has above been spoken.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Therefore it was enjoined upon the Hebrews</p>
<p class="slindent">To offer still, though sometimes what was offered</p>
<p class="slindent">Might be commuted, as thou ought&rsquo;st to know.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The other, which is known to thee as matter,</p>
<p class="slindent">May well indeed be such that one errs not</p>
<p class="slindent">If it for other matter be exchanged.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But let none shift the burden on his shoulder</p>
<p class="slindent">At his arbitrament, without the turning</p>
<p class="slindent">Both of the white and of the yellow key;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And every permutation deem as foolish,</p>
<p class="slindent">If in the substitute the thing relinquished,</p>
<p class="slindent">As the four is in six, be not contained.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Therefore whatever thing has so great weight</p>
<p class="slindent">In value that it drags down every balance,</p>
<p class="slindent">Cannot be satisfied with other spending.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Let mortals never take a vow in jest;</p>
<p class="slindent">Be faithful and not blind in doing that,</p>
<p class="slindent">As Jephthah was in his first offering,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Whom more beseemed to say, &lsquo;I have done wrong,</p>
<p class="slindent">Than to do worse by keeping; and as foolish</p>
<p class="slindent">Thou the great leader of the Greeks wilt find,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Whence wept Iphigenia her fair face,</p>
<p class="slindent">And made for her both wise and simple weep,</p>
<p class="slindent">Who heard such kind of worship spoken of.&rsquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Christians, be ye more serious in your movements;</p>
<p class="slindent">Be ye not like a feather at each wind,</p>
<p class="slindent">And think not every water washes you.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Ye have the Old and the New Testament,</p>
<p class="slindent">And the Pastor of the Church who guideth you</p>
<p class="slindent">Let this suffice you unto your salvation.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>If evil appetite cry aught else to you,</p>
<p class="slindent">Be ye as men, and not as silly sheep,</p>
<p class="slindent">So that the Jew among you may not mock you.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Be ye not as the lamb that doth abandon</p>
<p class="slindent">Its mother&rsquo;s milk, and frolicsome and simple</p>
<p class="slindent">Combats at its own pleasure with itself.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thus Beatrice to me even as I write it;</p>
<p class="slindent">Then all desireful turned herself again</p>
<p class="slindent">To that part where the world is most alive.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Her silence and her change of countenance</p>
<p class="slindent">Silence imposed upon my eager mind,</p>
<p class="slindent">That had already in advance new questions;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And as an arrow that upon the mark</p>
<p class="slindent">Strikes ere the bowstring quiet hath become,</p>
<p class="slindent">So did we speed into the second realm.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>My Lady there so joyful I beheld,</p>
<p class="slindent">As into the brightness of that heaven she entered,</p>
<p class="slindent">More luminous thereat the planet grew;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And if the star itself was changed and smiled,</p>
<p class="slindent">What became I, who by my nature am</p>
<p class="slindent">Exceeding mutable in every guise!</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>As, in a fish-pond which is pure and tranquil,</p>
<p class="slindent">The fishes draw to that which from without</p>
<p class="slindent">Comes in such fashion that their food they deem it;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So I beheld more than a thousand splendours</p>
<p class="slindent">Drawing towards us, and in each was heard:</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Lo, this is she who shall increase our love.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And as each one was coming unto us,</p>
<p class="slindent">Full of beatitude the shade was seen,</p>
<p class="slindent">By the effulgence clear that issued from it.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Think, Reader, if what here is just beginning</p>
<p class="slindent">No farther should proceed, how thou wouldst have</p>
<p class="slindent">An agonizing need of knowing more;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And of thyself thou&rsquo;lt see how I from these</p>
<p class="slindent">Was in desire of hearing their conditions,</p>
<p class="slindent">As they unto mine eyes were manifest.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;O thou well-born, unto whom Grace concedes</p>
<p class="slindent">To see the thrones of the eternal triumph,</p>
<p class="slindent">Or ever yet the warfare be abandoned</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>With light that through the whole of heaven is spread</p>
<p class="slindent">Kindled are we, and hence if thou desirest</p>
<p class="slindent">To know of us, at thine own pleasure sate thee.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thus by some one among those holy spirits</p>
<p class="slindent">Was spoken, and by Beatrice: &ldquo;Speak, speak</p>
<p class="slindent">Securely, and believe them even as Gods.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Well I perceive how thou dost nest thyself</p>
<p class="slindent">In thine own light, and drawest it from thine eyes,</p>
<p class="slindent">Because they coruscate when thou dost smile,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But know not who thou art, nor why thou hast,</p>
<p class="slindent">Spirit august, thy station in the sphere</p>
<p class="slindent">That veils itself to men in alien rays.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>This said I in direction of the light</p>
<p class="slindent">Which first had spoken to me; whence it became</p>
<p class="slindent">By far more lucent than it was before.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Even as the sun, that doth conceal himself</p>
<p class="slindent">By too much light, when heat has worn away</p>
<p class="slindent">The tempering influence of the vapours dense,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>By greater rapture thus concealed itself</p>
<p class="slindent">In its own radiance the figure saintly,</p>
<p class="slindent">And thus close, close enfolded answered me</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>In fashion as the following Canto sings.</p></div>`,

<p class="slindent">In the extreme of Europe held itself,</p>
<p class="slindent">Near to the mountains whence it issued first;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And under shadow of the sacred plumes</p>
<p class="slindent">It governed there the world from hand to hand,</p>
<p class="slindent">And, changing thus, upon mine own alighted.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Caesar I was, and am Justinian,</p>
<p class="slindent">Who, by the will of primal Love I feel,</p>
<p class="slindent">Took from the laws the useless and redundant;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And ere unto the work I was attent,</p>
<p class="slindent">One nature to exist in Christ, not more,</p>
<p class="slindent">Believed, and with such faith was I contented.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But blessed Agapetus, he who was</p>
<p class="slindent">The supreme pastor, to the faith sincere</p>
<p class="slindent">Pointed me out the way by words of his.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Him I believed, and what was his assertion</p>
<p class="slindent">I now see clearly, even as thou seest</p>
<p class="slindent">Each contradiction to be false and true.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>As soon as with the Church I moved my feet,</p>
<p class="slindent">God in his grace it pleased with this high task</p>
<p class="slindent">To inspire me, and I gave me wholly to it,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And to my Belisarius I commended</p>
<p class="slindent">The arms, to which was heaven&rsquo;s right hand so joined</p>
<p class="slindent">It was a signal that I should repose.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Now here to the first question terminates</p>

<p class="slindent">Men move against the standard sacrosanct,</p>
<p class="slindent">Both who appropriate and who oppose it.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Behold how great a power has made it worthy</p>
<p class="slindent">Of reverence, beginning from the hour</p>
<p class="slindent">When Pallas died to give it sovereignty.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thou knowest it made in Alba its abode</p>
<p class="slindent">Three hundred years and upward, till at last</p>
<p class="slindent">The three to three fought for it yet again.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thou knowest what it achieved from Sabine wrong</p>
<p class="slindent">Down to Lucretia&rsquo;s sorrow, in seven kings</p>
<p class="slindent">O&rsquo;ercoming round about the neighboring nations;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thou knowest what it achieved, borne by the Romans</p>
<p class="slindent">Illustrious against Brennus, against Pyrrhus,</p>
<p class="slindent">Against the other princes and confederates.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Torquatus thence and Quinctius, who from locks</p>
<p class="slindent">Unkempt was named, Decii and Fabii,</p>
<p class="slindent">Received the fame I willingly embalm;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>It struck to earth the pride of the Arabians,</p>
<p class="slindent">Who, following Hannibal, had passed across</p>
<p class="slindent">The Alpine ridges, Po, from which thou glidest;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Beneath it triumphed while they yet were young</p>
<p class="slindent">Pompey and Scipio, and to the hill</p>
<p class="slindent">Beneath which thou wast born it bitter seemed;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then, near unto the time when heaven had willed</p>
<p class="slindent">To bring the whole world to its mood serene,</p>
<p class="slindent">Did Caesar by the will of Rome assume it.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>What it achieved from Var unto the Rhine,</p>
<p class="slindent">Isere beheld and Saone, beheld the Seine,</p>
<p class="slindent">And every valley whence the Rhone is filled;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>What it achieved when it had left Ravenna,</p>
<p class="slindent">And leaped the Rubicon, was such a flight</p>
<p class="slindent">That neither tongue nor pen could follow it.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Round towards Spain it wheeled its legions; then</p>
<p class="slindent">Towards Durazzo, and Pharsalia smote</p>
<p class="slindent">That to the calid Nile was felt the pain.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Antandros and the Simois, whence it started,</p>
<p class="slindent">It saw again, and there where Hector lies,</p>
<p class="slindent">And ill for Ptolemy then roused itself.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>From thence it came like lightning upon Juba;</p>
<p class="slindent">Then wheeled itself again into your West,</p>
<p class="slindent">Where the Pompeian clarion it heard.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>From what it wrought with the next standard-bearer</p>
<p class="slindent">Brutus and Cassius howl in Hell together,</p>
<p class="slindent">And Modena and Perugia dolent were;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Still doth the mournful Cleopatra weep</p>
<p class="slindent">Because thereof, who, fleeing from before it,</p>
<p class="slindent">Took from the adder sudden and black death.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>With him it ran even to the Red Sea shore;</p>
<p class="slindent">With him it placed the world in so great peace,</p>
<p class="slindent">That unto Janus was his temple closed.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But what the standard that has made me speak</p>
<p class="slindent">Achieved before, and after should achieve</p>
<p class="slindent">Throughout the mortal realm that lies beneath it,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Becometh in appearance mean and dim,</p>
<p class="slindent">If in the hand of the third Caesar seen</p>
<p class="slindent">With eye unclouded and affection pure,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Because the living Justice that inspires me</p>
<p class="slindent">Granted it, in the hand of him I speak of,</p>
<p class="slindent">The glory of doing vengeance for its wrath.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Now here attend to what I answer thee;</p>
<p class="slindent">Later it ran with Titus to do vengeance</p>
<p class="slindent">Upon the vengeance of the ancient sin.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And when the tooth of Lombardy had bitten</p>
<p class="slindent">The Holy Church, then underneath its wings</p>
<p class="slindent">Did Charlemagne victorious succor her.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Now hast thou power to judge of such as those</p>
<p class="slindent">Whom I accused above, and of their crimes,</p>
<p class="slindent">Which are the cause of all your miseries.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>To the public standard one the yellow lilies</p>
<p class="slindent">Opposes, the other claims it for a party,</p>
<p class="slindent">So that &rsquo;tis hard to see which sins the most.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Let, let the Ghibellines ply their handicraft</p>
<p class="slindent">Beneath some other standard; for this ever</p>
<p class="slindent">Ill follows he who it and justice parts.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And let not this new Charles e&rsquo;er strike it down,</p>
<p class="slindent">He and his Guelfs, but let him fear the talons</p>
<p class="slindent">That from a nobler lion stripped the fell.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Already oftentimes the sons have wept</p>
<p class="slindent">The father&rsquo;s crime; and let him not believe</p>
<p class="slindent">That God will change His scutcheon for the lilies.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>This little planet doth adorn itself</p>
<p class="slindent">With the good spirits that have active been,</p>
<p class="slindent">That fame and honour might come after them;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And whensoever the desires mount thither,</p>
<p class="slindent">Thus deviating, must perforce the rays</p>
<p class="slindent">Of the true love less vividly mount upward.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But in commensuration of our wages</p>
<p class="slindent">With our desert is portion of our joy,</p>
<p class="slindent">Because we see them neither less nor greater.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Herein doth living Justice sweeten so</p>
<p class="slindent">Affection in us, that for evermore</p>
<p class="slindent">It cannot warp to any iniquity.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Voices diverse make up sweet melodies;</p>
<p class="slindent">So in this life of ours the seats diverse</p>
<p class="slindent">Render sweet harmony among these spheres;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And in the compass of this present pearl</p>
<p class="slindent">Shineth the sheen of Romeo, of whom</p>
<p class="slindent">The grand and beauteous work was ill rewarded.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But the Provencals who against him wrought,</p>
<p class="slindent">They have not laughed, and therefore ill goes he</p>
<p class="slindent">Who makes his hurt of the good deeds of others.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Four daughters, and each one of them a queen,</p>
<p class="slindent">Had Raymond Berenger, and this for him</p>
<p class="slindent">Did Romeo, a poor man and a pilgrim;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And then malicious words incited him</p>
<p class="slindent">To summon to a reckoning this just man,</p>
<p class="slindent">Who rendered to him seven and five for ten.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then he departed poor and stricken in years,</p>
<p class="slindent">And if the world could know the heart he had,</p>
<p class="slindent">In begging bit by bit his livelihood,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Though much it laud him, it would laud him more.&rdquo;</p></div>`,

`<p class="cantohead">Paradiso: Canto VII</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Osanna sanctus Deus Sabaoth,</p>
<p class="slindent">Superillustrans claritate tua</p>
<p class="slindent">Felices ignes horum malahoth!&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>In this wise, to his melody returning,</p>
<p class="slindent">This substance, upon which a double light</p>
<p class="slindent">Doubles itself, was seen by me to sing,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And to their dance this and the others moved,</p>
<p class="slindent">And in the manner of swift-hurrying sparks</p>
<p class="slindent">Veiled themselves from me with a sudden distance.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Doubting was I, and saying, &ldquo;Tell her, tell her,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Within me, &ldquo;tell her,&rdquo; saying, &ldquo;tell my Lady,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Who slakes my thirst with her sweet effluences;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And yet that reverence which doth lord it over</p>
<p class="slindent">The whole of me only by B and ICE,</p>
<p class="slindent">Bowed me again like unto one who drowses.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Short while did Beatrice endure me thus;</p>
<p class="slindent">And she began, lighting me with a smile</p>
<p class="slindent">Such as would make one happy in the fire:</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;According to infallible advisement,</p>
<p class="slindent">After what manner a just vengeance justly</p>
<p class="slindent">Could be avenged has put thee upon thinking,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But I will speedily thy mind unloose;</p>
<p class="slindent">And do thou listen, for these words of mine</p>
<p class="slindent">Of a great doctrine will a present make thee.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>By not enduring on the power that wills</p>
<p class="slindent">Curb for his good, that man who ne&rsquo;er was born,</p>
<p class="slindent">Damning himself damned all his progeny;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Whereby the human species down below</p>
<p class="slindent">Lay sick for many centuries in great error,</p>
<p class="slindent">Till to descend it pleased the Word of God</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>To where the nature, which from its own Maker</p>
<p class="slindent">Estranged itself, he joined to him in person</p>
<p class="slindent">By the sole act of his eternal love.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Now unto what is said direct thy sight;</p>
<p class="slindent">This nature when united to its Maker,</p>
<p class="slindent">Such as created, was sincere and good;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But by itself alone was banished forth</p>
<p class="slindent">From Paradise, because it turned aside</p>
<p class="slindent">Out of the way of truth and of its life.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Therefore the penalty the cross held out,</p>
<p class="slindent">If measured by the nature thus assumed,</p>
<p class="slindent">None ever yet with so great justice stung,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And none was ever of so great injustice,</p>
<p class="slindent">Considering who the Person was that suffered,</p>
<p class="slindent">Within whom such a nature was contracted.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>From one act therefore issued things diverse;</p>
<p class="slindent">To God and to the Jews one death was pleasing;</p>
<p class="slindent">Earth trembled at it and the Heaven was opened.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>It should no longer now seem difficult</p>
<p class="slindent">To thee, when it is said that a just vengeance</p>
<p class="slindent">By a just court was afterward avenged.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But now do I behold thy mind entangled</p>
<p class="slindent">From thought to thought within a knot, from which</p>
<p class="slindent">With great desire it waits to free itself.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thou sayest, &lsquo;Well discern I what I hear;</p>
<p class="slindent">But it is hidden from me why God willed</p>
<p class="slindent">For our redemption only this one mode.&rsquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Buried remaineth, brother, this decree</p>
<p class="slindent">Unto the eyes of every one whose nature</p>
<p class="slindent">Is in the flame of love not yet adult.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Verily, inasmuch as at this mark</p>
<p class="slindent">One gazes long and little is discerned,</p>
<p class="slindent">Wherefore this mode was worthiest will I say.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Goodness Divine, which from itself doth spurn</p>
<p class="slindent">All envy, burning in itself so sparkles</p>
<p class="slindent">That the eternal beauties it unfolds.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Whate&rsquo;er from this immediately distils</p>
<p class="slindent">Has afterwards no end, for ne&rsquo;er removed</p>
<p class="slindent">Is its impression when it sets its seal.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Whate&rsquo;er from this immediately rains down</p>
<p class="slindent">Is wholly free, because it is not subject</p>
<p class="slindent">Unto the influences of novel things.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The more conformed thereto, the more it pleases;</p>
<p class="slindent">For the blest ardour that irradiates all things</p>
<p class="slindent">In that most like itself is most vivacious.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>With all of these things has advantaged been</p>
<p class="slindent">The human creature; and if one be wanting,</p>
<p class="slindent">From his nobility he needs must fall.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&rsquo;Tis sin alone which doth disfranchise him,</p>
<p class="slindent">And render him unlike the Good Supreme,</p>
<p class="slindent">So that he little with its light is blanched,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And to his dignity no more returns,</p>
<p class="slindent">Unless he fill up where transgression empties</p>
<p class="slindent">With righteous pains for criminal delights.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Your nature when it sinned so utterly</p>
<p class="slindent">In its own seed, out of these dignities</p>
<p class="slindent">Even as out of Paradise was driven,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Nor could itself recover, if thou notest</p>
<p class="slindent">With nicest subtilty, by any way,</p>
<p class="slindent">Except by passing one of these two fords:</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Either that God through clemency alone</p>
<p class="slindent">Had pardon granted, or that man himself</p>
<p class="slindent">Had satisfaction for his folly made.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Fix now thine eye deep into the abyss</p>
<p class="slindent">Of the eternal counsel, to my speech</p>
<p class="slindent">As far as may be fastened steadfastly!</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Man in his limitations had not power</p>
<p class="slindent">To satisfy, not having power to sink</p>
<p class="slindent">In his humility obeying then,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Far as he disobeying thought to rise;</p>
<p class="slindent">And for this reason man has been from power</p>
<p class="slindent">Of satisfying by himself excluded.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Therefore it God behoved in his own ways</p>
<p class="slindent">Man to restore unto his perfect life,</p>
<p class="slindent">I say in one, or else in both of them.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But since the action of the doer is</p>
<p class="slindent">So much more grateful, as it more presents</p>
<p class="slindent">The goodness of the heart from which it issues,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Goodness Divine, that doth imprint the world,</p>
<p class="slindent">Has been contented to proceed by each</p>
<p class="slindent">And all its ways to lift you up again;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Nor &rsquo;twixt the first day and the final night</p>
<p class="slindent">Such high and such magnificent proceeding</p>
<p class="slindent">By one or by the other was or shall be;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>For God more bounteous was himself to give</p>
<p class="slindent">To make man able to uplift himself,</p>
<p class="slindent">Than if he only of himself had pardoned;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And all the other modes were insufficient</p>
<p class="slindent">For justice, were it not the Son of God</p>
<p class="slindent">Himself had humbled to become incarnate.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Now, to fill fully each desire of thine,</p>
<p class="slindent">Return I to elucidate one place,</p>
<p class="slindent">In order that thou there mayst see as I do.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thou sayst: &lsquo;I see the air, I see the fire,</p>
<p class="slindent">The water, and the earth, and all their mixtures</p>
<p class="slindent">Come to corruption, and short while endure;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And these things notwithstanding were created;&rsquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Therefore if that which I have said were true,</p>
<p class="slindent">They should have been secure against corruption.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The Angels, brother, and the land sincere</p>
<p class="slindent">In which thou art, created may be called</p>
<p class="slindent">Just as they are in their entire existence;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But all the elements which thou hast named,</p>
<p class="slindent">And all those things which out of them are made,</p>
<p class="slindent">By a created virtue are informed.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Created was the matter which they have;</p>
<p class="slindent">Created was the informing influence</p>
<p class="slindent">Within these stars that round about them go.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The soul of every brute and of the plants</p>
<p class="slindent">By its potential temperament attracts</p>
<p class="slindent">The ray and motion of the holy lights;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But your own life immediately inspires</p>
<p class="slindent">Supreme Beneficence, and enamours it</p>
<p class="slindent">So with herself, it evermore desires her.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And thou from this mayst argue furthermore</p>
<p class="slindent">Your resurrection, if thou think again</p>
<p class="slindent">How human flesh was fashioned at that time</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>When the first parents both of them were made.&rdquo;</p></div>`,

`<p class="cantohead">Paradiso: Canto VIII</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>And they from her, whence I beginning take,</p>
<p class="slindent">Took the denomination of the star</p>
<p class="slindent">That woos the sun, now following, now in front.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I was not ware of our ascending to it;</p>
<p class="slindent">But of our being in it gave full faith</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>And as within a flame a spark is seen,</p>
<p class="slindent">And as within a voice a voice discerned,</p>
<p class="slindent">When one is steadfast, and one comes and goes,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Within that light beheld I other lamps</p>
<p class="slindent">Move in a circle, speeding more and less,</p>
<p class="slindent">Methinks in measure of their inward vision.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>From a cold cloud descended never winds,</p>
<p class="slindent">Or visible or not, so rapidly</p>
<p class="slindent">They would not laggard and impeded seem</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>To any one who had those lights divine</p>
<p class="slindent">Seen come towards us, leaving the gyration</p>
<p class="slindent">Begun at first in the high Seraphim.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And behind those that most in front appeared</p>
<p class="slindent">Sounded &ldquo;Osanna!&rdquo; so that never since</p>

<p class="slindent">To whom thou in the world of old didst say,</p></div>

<p class="slindent">And are so full of love, to pleasure thee</p>
<p class="slindent">A little quiet will not be less sweet.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>After these eyes of mine themselves had offered</p>
<p class="slindent">Unto my Lady reverently, and she</p>
<p class="slindent">Content and certain of herself had made them,</p></div>

<p class="slindent">Made of itself, and &ldquo;Say, who art thou?&rdquo; was</p>
<p class="slindent">My voice, imprinted with a great affection.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>O how and how much I beheld it grow</p>
<p class="slindent">With the new joy that superadded was</p>
<p class="slindent">Unto its joys, as soon as I had spoken!</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thus changed, it said to me: &ldquo;The world possessed me</p>

<p class="slindent">A splendour was of light cherubical.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>One will I speak of, for of both is spoken</p>
<p class="slindent">In praising one, whichever may be taken,</p>
<p class="slindent">Because unto one end their labours were.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Between Tupino and the stream that falls</p>
<p class="slindent">Down from the hill elect of blessed Ubald,</p>
<p class="slindent">A fertile slope of lofty mountain hangs,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>From which Perugia feels the cold and heat</p>
<p class="slindent">Through Porta Sole, and behind it weep</p>
<p class="slindent">Gualdo and Nocera their grievous yoke.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>From out that slope, there where it breaketh most</p>
<p class="slindent">Its steepness, rose upon the world a sun</p>
<p class="slindent">As this one does sometimes from out the Ganges;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Therefore let him who speaketh of that place,</p>
<p class="slindent">Say not Ascesi, for he would say little,</p>
<p class="slindent">But Orient, if he properly would speak.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>He was not yet far distant from his rising</p>
<p class="slindent">Before he had begun to make the earth</p>
<p class="slindent">Some comfort from his mighty virtue feel.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>For he in youth his father&rsquo;s wrath incurred</p>
<p class="slindent">For certain Dame, to whom, as unto death,</p>
<p class="slindent">The gate of pleasure no one doth unlock;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And was before his spiritual court</p>
<p class="slindent">&lsquo;Et coram patre&rsquo; unto her united;</p>
<p class="slindent">Then day by day more fervently he loved her.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>She, reft of her first husband, scorned, obscure,</p>
<p class="slindent">One thousand and one hundred years and more,</p>
<p class="slindent">Waited without a suitor till he came.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Naught it availed to hear, that with Amyclas</p>
<p class="slindent">Found her unmoved at sounding of his voice</p>
<p class="slindent">He who struck terror into all the world;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Naught it availed being constant and undaunted,</p>
<p class="slindent">So that, when Mary still remained below,</p>
<p class="slindent">She mounted up with Christ upon the cross.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But that too darkly I may not proceed,</p>
<p class="slindent">Francis and Poverty for these two lovers</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>Their concord and their joyous semblances,</p>
<p class="slindent">The love, the wonder, and the sweet regard,</p>
<p class="slindent">They made to be the cause of holy thoughts;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So much so that the venerable Bernard</p>
<p class="slindent">First bared his feet, and after so great peace</p>
<p class="slindent">Ran, and, in running, thought himself too slow.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Nor cowardice of heart weighed down his brow</p>
<p class="slindent">At being son of Peter Bernardone,</p>
<p class="slindent">Nor for appearing marvellously scorned;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But regally his hard determination</p>
<p class="slindent">To Innocent he opened, and from him</p>
<p class="slindent">Received the primal seal upon his Order.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>After the people mendicant increased</p>
<p class="slindent">Behind this man, whose admirable life</p>

<p class="slindent">Christ and the others who came after him,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And, finding for conversion too unripe</p>
<p class="slindent">The folk, and not to tarry there in vain,</p>
<p class="slindent">Returned to fruit of the Italic grass,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>On the rude rock &rsquo;twixt Tiber and the Arno</p>
<p class="slindent">From Christ did he receive the final seal,</p>
<p class="slindent">Which during two whole years his members bore.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>When He, who chose him unto so much good,</p>
<p class="slindent">Was pleased to draw him up to the reward</p>
<p class="slindent">That he had merited by being lowly,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Unto his friars, as to the rightful heirs,</p>
<p class="slindent">His most dear Lady did he recommend,</p>
<p class="slindent">And bade that they should love her faithfully;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And from her bosom the illustrious soul</p>
<p class="slindent">Wished to depart, returning to its realm,</p>
<p class="slindent">And for its body wished no other bier.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Think now what man was he, who was a fit</p>
<p class="slindent">Companion over the high seas to keep</p>
<p class="slindent">The bark of Peter to its proper bearings.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And in its gyre had not turned wholly round,</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>Song that as greatly doth transcend our Muses,</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>The soldiery of Christ, which it had cost</p>

<p class="slindent">With champions twain, at whose deed, at whose word</p>
<p class="slindent">The straggling people were together drawn.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Within that region where the sweet west wind</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>Not far off from the beating of the waves,</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>Is situate the fortunate Calahorra,</p>
<p class="slindent">Under protection of the mighty shield</p>
<p class="slindent">In which the Lion subject is and sovereign.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Therein was born the amorous paramour</p>
<p class="slindent">Of Christian Faith, the athlete consecrate,</p>
<p class="slindent">Kind to his own and cruel to his foes;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And when it was created was his mind</p>
<p class="slindent">Replete with such a living energy,</p>
<p class="slindent">That in his mother her it made prophetic.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>As soon as the espousals were complete</p>

<p class="slindent">Where they with mutual safety dowered each other,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The woman, who for him had given assent,</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>Envoy and servant sooth he seemed of Christ,</p>
<p class="slindent">For the first love made manifest in him</p>
<p class="slindent">Was the first counsel that was given by Christ.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Silent and wakeful many a time was he</p>
<p class="slindent">Discovered by his nurse upon the ground,</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>O thou his father, Felix verily!</p>
<p class="slindent">O thou his mother, verily Joanna,</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>Not for the world which people toil for now</p>
<p class="slindent">In following Ostiense and Taddeo,</p>
<p class="slindent">But through his longing after the true manna,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>He in short time became so great a teacher,</p>
<p class="slindent">That he began to go about the vineyard,</p>
<p class="slindent">Which fadeth soon, if faithless be the dresser;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And of the See, (that once was more benignant</p>
<p class="slindent">Unto the righteous poor, not through itself,</p>
<p class="slindent">But him who sits there and degenerates,)</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Not to dispense or two or three for six,</p>
<p class="slindent">Not any fortune of first vacancy,</p>
<p class="slindent">&lsquo;Non decimas quae sunt pauperum Dei,&rsquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>He asked for, but against the errant world</p>
<p class="slindent">Permission to do battle for the seed,</p>
<p class="slindent">Of which these four and twenty plants surround thee.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then with the doctrine and the will together,</p>
<p class="slindent">With office apostolical he moved,</p>
<p class="slindent">Like torrent which some lofty vein out-presses;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And in among the shoots heretical</p>
<p class="slindent">His impetus with greater fury smote,</p>
<p class="slindent">Wherever the resistance was the greatest.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Of him were made thereafter divers runnels,</p>
<p class="slindent">Whereby the garden catholic is watered,</p>
<p class="slindent">So that more living its plantations stand.</p></div>

<p class="slindent">The excellence of the other, unto whom</p>
<p class="slindent">Thomas so courteous was before my coming.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But still the orbit, which the highest part</p>
<p class="slindent">Of its circumference made, is derelict,</p>
<p class="slindent">So that the mould is where was once the crust.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>His family, that had straight forward moved</p>
<p class="slindent">With feet upon his footprints, are turned round</p>
<p class="slindent">So that they set the point upon the heel.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Bonaventura of Bagnoregio&rsquo;s life</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>And with me they have moved this company.&rdquo;</p></div>`,

`<p class="cantohead">Paradiso: Canto XIII</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>Let him imagine, who would well conceive</p>
<p class="slindent">What now I saw, and let him while I speak</p>
<p class="slindent">Retain the image as a steadfast rock,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The fifteen stars, that in their divers regions</p>
<p class="slindent">The sky enliven with a light so great</p>
<p class="slindent">That it transcends all clusters of the air;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Let him the Wain imagine unto which</p>
<p class="slindent">Our vault of heaven sufficeth night and day,</p>
<p class="slindent">So that in turning of its pole it fails not;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Let him the mouth imagine of the horn</p>
<p class="slindent">That in the point beginneth of the axis</p>
<p class="slindent">Round about which the primal wheel revolves,—</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>To have fashioned of themselves two signs in heaven,</p>
<p class="slindent">Like unto that which Minos&rsquo; daughter made,</p>
<p class="slindent">The moment when she felt the frost of death;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And one to have its rays within the other,</p>
<p class="slindent">And both to whirl themselves in such a manner</p>
<p class="slindent">That one should forward go, the other backward;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And he will have some shadowing forth of that</p>
<p class="slindent">True constellation and the double dance</p>
<p class="slindent">That circled round the point at which I was;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Because it is as much beyond our wont,</p>
<p class="slindent">As swifter than the motion of the Chiana</p>
<p class="slindent">Moveth the heaven that all the rest outspeeds.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>There sang they neither Bacchus, nor Apollo,</p>
<p class="slindent">But in the divine nature Persons three,</p>
<p class="slindent">And in one person the divine and human.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The singing and the dance fulfilled their measure,</p>
<p class="slindent">And unto us those holy lights gave need,</p>
<p class="slindent">Growing in happiness from care to care.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then broke the silence of those saints concordant</p>
<p class="slindent">The light in which the admirable life</p>
<p class="slindent">Of God&rsquo;s own mendicant was told to me,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And said: &ldquo;Now that one straw is trodden out</p>
<p class="slindent">Now that its seed is garnered up already,</p>
<p class="slindent">Sweet love invites me to thresh out the other.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Into that bosom, thou believest, whence</p>
<p class="slindent">Was drawn the rib to form the beauteous cheek</p>
<p class="slindent">Whose taste to all the world is costing dear,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And into that which, by the lance transfixed,</p>
<p class="slindent">Before and since, such satisfaction made</p>
<p class="slindent">That it weighs down the balance of all sin,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Whate&rsquo;er of light it has to human nature</p>
<p class="slindent">Been lawful to possess was all infused</p>
<p class="slindent">By the same power that both of them created;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And hence at what I said above dost wonder,</p>
<p class="slindent">When I narrated that no second had</p>
<p class="slindent">The good which in the fifth light is enclosed.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Now ope thine eyes to what I answer thee,</p>
<p class="slindent">And thou shalt see thy creed and my discourse</p>
<p class="slindent">Fit in the truth as centre in a circle.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>That which can die, and that which dieth not,</p>
<p class="slindent">Are nothing but the splendour of the idea</p>
<p class="slindent">Which by his love our Lord brings into being;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Because that living Light, which from its fount</p>
<p class="slindent">Effulgent flows, so that it disunites not</p>
<p class="slindent">From Him nor from the Love in them intrined,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Through its own goodness reunites its rays</p>
<p class="slindent">In nine subsistences, as in a mirror,</p>
<p class="slindent">Itself eternally remaining One.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thence it descends to the last potencies,</p>
<p class="slindent">Downward from act to act becoming such</p>
<p class="slindent">That only brief contingencies it makes;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And these contingencies I hold to be</p>
<p class="slindent">Things generated, which the heaven produces</p>
<p class="slindent">By its own motion, with seed and without.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Neither their wax, nor that which tempers it,</p>
<p class="slindent">Remains immutable, and hence beneath</p>
<p class="slindent">The ideal signet more and less shines through;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Therefore it happens, that the selfsame tree</p>
<p class="slindent">After its kind bears worse and better fruit,</p>
<p class="slindent">And ye are born with characters diverse.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>If in perfection tempered were the wax,</p>
<p class="slindent">And were the heaven in its supremest virtue,</p>
<p class="slindent">The brilliance of the seal would all appear;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But nature gives it evermore deficient,</p>
<p class="slindent">In the like manner working as the artist,</p>
<p class="slindent">Who has the skill of art and hand that trembles.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>If then the fervent Love, the Vision clear,</p>
<p class="slindent">Of primal Virtue do dispose and seal,</p>
<p class="slindent">Perfection absolute is there acquired.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thus was of old the earth created worthy</p>
<p class="slindent">Of all and every animal perfection;</p>
<p class="slindent">And thus the Virgin was impregnate made;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So that thine own opinion I commend,</p>
<p class="slindent">That human nature never yet has been,</p>
<p class="slindent">Nor will be, what it was in those two persons.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Now if no farther forth I should proceed,</p>
<p class="slindent">&lsquo;Then in what way was he without a peer?&rsquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Would be the first beginning of thy words.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But, that may well appear what now appears not,</p>
<p class="slindent">Think who he was, and what occasion moved him</p>
<p class="slindent">To make request, when it was told him, &lsquo;Ask.&rsquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I&rsquo;ve not so spoken that thou canst not see</p>
<p class="slindent">Clearly he was a king who asked for wisdom,</p>
<p class="slindent">That he might be sufficiently a king;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&rsquo;Twas not to know the number in which are</p>
<p class="slindent">The motors here above, or if &lsquo;necesse&rsquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">With a contingent e&rsquo;er &lsquo;necesse&rsquo; make,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&lsquo;Non si est dare primum motum esse,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Or if in semicircle can be made</p>
<p class="slindent">Triangle so that it have no right angle.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Whence, if thou notest this and what I said,</p>
<p class="slindent">A regal prudence is that peerless seeing</p>
<p class="slindent">In which the shaft of my intention strikes.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And if on &lsquo;rose&rsquo; thou turnest thy clear eyes,</p>
<p class="slindent">Thou&rsquo;lt see that it has reference alone</p>
<p class="slindent">To kings who&rsquo;re many, and the good are rare.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>With this distinction take thou what I said,</p>
<p class="slindent">And thus it can consist with thy belief</p>
<p class="slindent">Of the first father and of our Delight.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And lead shall this be always to thy feet,</p>
<p class="slindent">To make thee, like a weary man, move slowly</p>
<p class="slindent">Both to the Yes and No thou seest not;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>For very low among the fools is he</p>
<p class="slindent">Who affirms without distinction, or denies,</p>
<p class="slindent">As well in one as in the other case;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Because it happens that full often bends</p>
<p class="slindent">Current opinion in the false direction,</p>
<p class="slindent">And then the feelings bind the intellect.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Far more than uselessly he leaves the shore,</p>
<p class="slindent">(Since he returneth not the same he went,)</p>
<p class="slindent">Who fishes for the truth, and has no skill;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>At Montemurlo still would be the Counts,</p>
<p class="slindent">The Cerchi in the parish of Acone,</p>
<p class="slindent">Perhaps in Valdigrieve the Buondelmonti.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Ever the intermingling of the people</p>
<p class="slindent">Has been the source of malady in cities,</p>
<p class="slindent">As in the body food it surfeits on;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And a blind bull more headlong plunges down</p>
<p class="slindent">Than a blind lamb; and very often cuts</p>
<p class="slindent">Better and more a single sword than five.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>If Luni thou regard, and Urbisaglia,</p>
<p class="slindent">How they have passed away, and how are passing</p>
<p class="slindent">Chiusi and Sinigaglia after them,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>To hear how races waste themselves away,</p>
<p class="slindent">Will seem to thee no novel thing nor hard,</p>
<p class="slindent">Seeing that even cities have an end.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>All things of yours have their mortality,</p>
<p class="slindent">Even as yourselves; but it is hidden in some</p>
<p class="slindent">That a long while endure, and lives are short;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And as the turning of the lunar heaven</p>
<p class="slindent">Covers and bares the shores without a pause,</p>
<p class="slindent">In the like manner fortune does with Florence.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Therefore should not appear a marvellous thing</p>
<p class="slindent">What I shall say of the great Florentines</p>
<p class="slindent">Of whom the fame is hidden in the Past.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I saw the Ughi, saw the Catellini,</p>
<p class="slindent">Filippi, Greci, Ormanni, and Alberichi,</p>
<p class="slindent">Even in their fall illustrious citizens;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And saw, as mighty as they ancient were,</p>
<p class="slindent">With him of La Sannella him of Arca,</p>
<p class="slindent">And Soldanier, Ardinghi, and Bostichi.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Near to the gate that is at present laden</p>
<p class="slindent">With a new felony of so much weight</p>
<p class="slindent">That soon it shall be jetsam from the bark,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The Ravignani were, from whom descended</p>
<p class="slindent">The County Guido, and whoe&rsquo;er the name</p>
<p class="slindent">Of the great Bellincione since hath taken.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>He of La Pressa knew the art of ruling</p>
<p class="slindent">Already, and already Galigajo</p>
<p class="slindent">Had hilt and pommel gilded in his house.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Mighty already was the Column Vair,</p>
<p class="slindent">Sacchetti, Giuochi, Fifant, and Barucci,</p>
<p class="slindent">And Galli, and they who for the bushel blush.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The stock from which were the Calfucci born</p>
<p class="slindent">Was great already, and already chosen</p>
<p class="slindent">To curule chairs the Sizii and Arrigucci.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>O how beheld I those who are undone</p>
<p class="slindent">By their own pride! and how the Balls of Gold</p>
<p class="slindent">Florence enflowered in all their mighty deeds!</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So likewise did the ancestors of those</p>
<p class="slindent">Who evermore, when vacant is your church,</p>
<p class="slindent">Fatten by staying in consistory.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The insolent race, that like a dragon follows</p>
<p class="slindent">Whoever flees, and unto him that shows</p>
<p class="slindent">His teeth or purse is gentle as a lamb,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Already rising was, but from low people;</p>
<p class="slindent">So that it pleased not Ubertin Donato</p>
<p class="slindent">That his wife&rsquo;s father should make him their kin.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Already had Caponsacco to the Market</p>
<p class="slindent">From Fesole descended, and already</p>
<p class="slindent">Giuda and Infangato were good burghers.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I&rsquo;ll tell a thing incredible, but true;</p>
<p class="slindent">One entered the small circuit by a gate</p>
<p class="slindent">Which from the Della Pera took its name!</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Each one that bears the beautiful escutcheon</p>
<p class="slindent">Of the great baron whose renown and name</p>
<p class="slindent">The festival of Thomas keepeth fresh,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Knighthood and privilege from him received;</p>
<p class="slindent">Though with the populace unites himself</p>
<p class="slindent">To-day the man who binds it with a border.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Already were Gualterotti and Importuni;</p>
<p class="slindent">And still more quiet would the Borgo be</p>
<p class="slindent">If with new neighbours it remained unfed.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The house from which is born your lamentation,</p>
<p class="slindent">Through just disdain that death among you brought</p>
<p class="slindent">And put an end unto your joyous life,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Was honoured in itself and its companions.</p>
<p class="slindent">O Buondelmonte, how in evil hour</p>
<p class="slindent">Thou fled&rsquo;st the bridal at another&rsquo;s promptings!</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Many would be rejoicing who are sad,</p>
<p class="slindent">If God had thee surrendered to the Ema</p>
<p class="slindent">The first time that thou camest to the city.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But it behoved the mutilated stone</p>
<p class="slindent">Which guards the bridge, that Florence should provide</p>
<p class="slindent">A victim in her latest hour of peace.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>With all these families, and others with them,</p>
<p class="slindent">Florence beheld I in so great repose,</p>
<p class="slindent">That no occasion had she whence to weep;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>With all these families beheld so just</p>
<p class="slindent">And glorious her people, that the lily</p>
<p class="slindent">Never upon the spear was placed reversed,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Nor by division was vermilion made.&rdquo;</p></div>`,

`<p class="cantohead">Paradiso: Canto XVII</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>As came to Clymene, to be made certain</p>
<p class="slindent">Of that which he had heard against himself,</p>
<p class="slindent">He who makes fathers chary still to children,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Even such was I, and such was I perceived</p>
<p class="slindent">By Beatrice and by the holy light</p>
<p class="slindent">That first on my account had changed its place.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Therefore my Lady said to me: &ldquo;Send forth</p>
<p class="slindent">The flame of thy desire, so that it issue</p>
<p class="slindent">Imprinted well with the internal stamp;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Not that our knowledge may be greater made</p>
<p class="slindent">By speech of thine, but to accustom thee</p>
<p class="slindent">To tell thy thirst, that we may give thee drink.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;O my beloved tree, (that so dost lift thee,</p>
<p class="slindent">That even as minds terrestrial perceive</p>
<p class="slindent">No triangle containeth two obtuse,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So thou beholdest the contingent things</p>
<p class="slindent">Ere in themselves they are, fixing thine eyes</p>
<p class="slindent">Upon the point in which all times are present,)</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>While I was with Virgilius conjoined</p>
<p class="slindent">Upon the mountain that the souls doth heal,</p>
<p class="slindent">And when descending into the dead world,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Were spoken to me of my future life</p>
<p class="slindent">Some grievous words; although I feel myself</p>
<p class="slindent">In sooth foursquare against the blows of chance.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>On this account my wish would be content</p>
<p class="slindent">To hear what fortune is approaching me,</p>
<p class="slindent">Because foreseen an arrow comes more slowly.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thus did I say unto that selfsame light</p>
<p class="slindent">That unto me had spoken before; and even</p>
<p class="slindent">As Beatrice willed was my own will confessed.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Not in vague phrase, in which the foolish folk</p>
<p class="slindent">Ensnared themselves of old, ere yet was slain</p>
<p class="slindent">The Lamb of God who taketh sins away,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But with clear words and unambiguous</p>
<p class="slindent">Language responded that paternal love,</p>
<p class="slindent">Hid and revealed by its own proper smile:</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Contingency, that outside of the volume</p>
<p class="slindent">Of your materiality extends not,</p>
<p class="slindent">Is all depicted in the eternal aspect.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Necessity however thence it takes not,</p>
<p class="slindent">Except as from the eye, in which &rsquo;tis mirrored,</p>
<p class="slindent">A ship that with the current down descends.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>From thence, e&rsquo;en as there cometh to the ear</p>
<p class="slindent">Sweet harmony from an organ, comes in sight</p>
<p class="slindent">To me the time that is preparing for thee.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>As forth from Athens went Hippolytus,</p>
<p class="slindent">By reason of his step-dame false and cruel,</p>
<p class="slindent">So thou from Florence must perforce depart.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Already this is willed, and this is sought for;</p>
<p class="slindent">And soon it shall be done by him who thinks it,</p>
<p class="slindent">Where every day the Christ is bought and sold.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The blame shall follow the offended party</p>
<p class="slindent">In outcry as is usual; but the vengeance</p>
<p class="slindent">Shall witness to the truth that doth dispense it.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thou shalt abandon everything beloved</p>
<p class="slindent">Most tenderly, and this the arrow is</p>
<p class="slindent">Which first the bow of banishment shoots forth.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thou shalt have proof how savoureth of salt</p>
<p class="slindent">The bread of others, and how hard a road</p>
<p class="slindent">The going down and up another&rsquo;s stairs.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And that which most shall weigh upon thy shoulders</p>
<p class="slindent">Will be the bad and foolish company</p>
<p class="slindent">With which into this valley thou shalt fall;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>For all ingrate, all mad and impious</p>
<p class="slindent">Will they become against thee; but soon after</p>
<p class="slindent">They, and not thou, shall have the forehead scarlet.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Of their bestiality their own proceedings</p>
<p class="slindent">Shall furnish proof; so &rsquo;twill be well for thee</p>
<p class="slindent">A party to have made thee by thyself.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thine earliest refuge and thine earliest inn</p>
<p class="slindent">Shall be the mighty Lombard&rsquo;s courtesy,</p>
<p class="slindent">Who on the Ladder bears the holy bird,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Who such benign regard shall have for thee</p>
<p class="slindent">That &rsquo;twixt you twain, in doing and in asking,</p>
<p class="slindent">That shall be first which is with others last.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>With him shalt thou see one who at his birth</p>
<p class="slindent">Has by this star of strength been so impressed,</p>
<p class="slindent">That notable shall his achievements be.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Not yet the people are aware of him</p>
<p class="slindent">Through his young age, since only nine years yet</p>
<p class="slindent">Around about him have these wheels revolved.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But ere the Gascon cheat the noble Henry,</p>
<p class="slindent">Some sparkles of his virtue shall appear</p>
<p class="slindent">In caring not for silver nor for toil.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So recognized shall his magnificence</p>
<p class="slindent">Become hereafter, that his enemies</p>
<p class="slindent">Will not have power to keep mute tongues about it.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>On him rely, and on his benefits;</p>
<p class="slindent">By him shall many people be transformed,</p>
<p class="slindent">Changing condition rich and mendicant;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And written in thy mind thou hence shalt bear</p>
<p class="slindent">Of him, but shalt not say it&rdquo;&mdash;and things said he</p>
<p class="slindent">Incredible to those who shall be present.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then added: &ldquo;Son, these are the commentaries</p>
<p class="slindent">On what was said to thee; behold the snares</p>
<p class="slindent">That are concealed behind few revolutions;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Yet would I not thy neighbours thou shouldst envy,</p>
<p class="slindent">Because thy life into the future reaches</p>
<p class="slindent">Beyond the punishment of their perfidies.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>When by its silence showed that sainted soul</p>
<p class="slindent">That it had finished putting in the woof</p>
<p class="slindent">Into that web which I had given it warped,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Began I, even as he who yearneth after,</p>
<p class="slindent">Being in doubt, some counsel from a person</p>
<p class="slindent">Who seeth, and uprightly wills, and loves:</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Well see I, father mine, how spurreth on</p>
<p class="slindent">The time towards me such a blow to deal me</p>
<p class="slindent">As heaviest is to him who most gives way.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Therefore with foresight it is well I arm me,</p>
<p class="slindent">That, if the dearest place be taken from me,</p>
<p class="slindent">I may not lose the others by my songs.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Down through the world of infinite bitterness,</p>
<p class="slindent">And o&rsquo;er the mountain, from whose beauteous summit</p>
<p class="slindent">The eyes of my own Lady lifted me,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And afterward through heaven from light to light,</p>
<p class="slindent">I have learned that which, if I tell again,</p>
<p class="slindent">Will be a savour of strong herbs to many.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And if I am a timid friend to truth,</p>
<p class="slindent">I fear lest I may lose my life with those</p>
<p class="slindent">Who will hereafter call this time the olden.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The light in which was smiling my own treasure</p>
<p class="slindent">Which there I had discovered, flashed at first</p>
<p class="slindent">As in the sunshine doth a golden mirror;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then made reply: &ldquo;A conscience overcast</p>
<p class="slindent">Or with its own or with another&rsquo;s shame,</p>
<p class="slindent">Will taste forsooth the tartness of thy word;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But ne&rsquo;ertheless, all falsehood laid aside,</p>
<p class="slindent">Make manifest thy vision utterly,</p>
<p class="slindent">And let them scratch wherever is the itch;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>For if thine utterance shall offensive be</p>
<p class="slindent">At the first taste, a vital nutriment</p>
<p class="slindent">&rsquo;Twill leave thereafter, when it is digested.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>This cry of thine shall do as doth the wind,</p>
<p class="slindent">Which smiteth most the most exalted summits,</p>
<p class="slindent">And that is no slight argument of honour.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Therefore are shown to thee within these wheels,</p>
<p class="slindent">Upon the mount and in the dolorous valley,</p>
<p class="slindent">Only the souls that unto fame are known;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Because the spirit of the hearer rests not,</p>
<p class="slindent">Nor doth confirm its faith by an example</p>
<p class="slindent">Which has the root of it unknown and hidden,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Or other reason that is not apparent.&rdquo;</p></div>`,

`<p class="cantohead">Paradiso: Canto XVIII</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>Now was alone rejoicing in its word</p>
<p class="slindent">That soul beatified, and I was tasting</p>
<p class="slindent">My own, the bitter tempering with the sweet,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And the Lady who to God was leading me</p>
<p class="slindent">Said: &ldquo;Change thy thought; consider that I am</p>
<p class="slindent">Near unto Him who every wrong disburdens.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Unto the loving accents of my comfort</p>
<p class="slindent">I turned me round, and then what love I saw</p>
<p class="slindent">Within those holy eyes I here relinquish;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Not only that my language I distrust,</p>
<p class="slindent">But that my mind cannot return so far</p>
<p class="slindent">Above itself, unless another guide it.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thus much upon that point can I repeat,</p>
<p class="slindent">That, her again beholding, my affection</p>
<p class="slindent">From every other longing was released.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>While the eternal pleasure, which direct</p>
<p class="slindent">Rayed upon Beatrice, from her fair face</p>
<p class="slindent">Contented me with its reflected aspect,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Conquering me with the radiance of a smile,</p>
<p class="slindent">She said to me, &ldquo;Turn thee about and listen;</p>
<p class="slindent">Not in mine eyes alone is Paradise.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Even as sometimes here do we behold</p>
<p class="slindent">The affection in the look, if it be such</p>
<p class="slindent">That all the soul is wrapt away by it,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So, by the flaming of the effulgence holy</p>
<p class="slindent">To which I turned, I recognized therein</p>
<p class="slindent">The wish of speaking to me somewhat farther.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And it began: &ldquo;In this fifth resting-place</p>
<p class="slindent">Upon the tree that liveth by its summit,</p>
<p class="slindent">And aye bears fruit, and never loses leaf,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Are blessed spirits that below, ere yet</p>
<p class="slindent">They came to Heaven, were of such great renown</p>
<p class="slindent">That every Muse therewith would affluent be.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Therefore look thou upon the cross&rsquo;s horns;</p>
<p class="slindent">He whom I now shall name will there enact</p>
<p class="slindent">What doth within a cloud its own swift fire.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I saw athwart the Cross a splendour drawn</p>
<p class="slindent">By naming Joshua, (even as he did it,)</p>
<p class="slindent">Nor noted I the word before the deed;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And at the name of the great Maccabee</p>
<p class="slindent">I saw another move itself revolving,</p>
<p class="slindent">And gladness was the whip unto that top.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Likewise for Charlemagne and for Orlando,</p>
<p class="slindent">Two of them my regard attentive followed</p>
<p class="slindent">As followeth the eye its falcon flying.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>William thereafterward, and Renouard,</p>
<p class="slindent">And the Duke Godfrey, did attract my sight</p>
<p class="slindent">Along upon that Cross, and Robert Guiscard.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then, moved and mingled with the other lights,</p>
<p class="slindent">The soul that had addressed me showed how great</p>
<p class="slindent">An artist &rsquo;twas among the heavenly singers.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>To my right side I turned myself around,</p>
<p class="slindent">My duty to behold in Beatrice</p>
<p class="slindent">Either by words or gesture signified;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And so translucent I beheld her eyes,</p>
<p class="slindent">So full of pleasure, that her countenance</p>
<p class="slindent">Surpassed its other and its latest wont.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And as, by feeling greater delectation,</p>
<p class="slindent">A man in doing good from day to day</p>
<p class="slindent">Becomes aware his virtue is increasing,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So I became aware that my gyration</p>
<p class="slindent">With heaven together had increased its arc,</p>
<p class="slindent">That miracle beholding more adorned.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And such as is the change, in little lapse</p>
<p class="slindent">Of time, in a pale woman, when her face</p>
<p class="slindent">Is from the load of bashfulness unladen,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Such was it in mine eyes, when I had turned,</p>
<p class="slindent">Caused by the whiteness of the temperate star,</p>
<p class="slindent">The sixth, which to itself had gathered me.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Within that Jovial torch did I behold</p>
<p class="slindent">The sparkling of the love which was therein</p>
<p class="slindent">Delineate our language to mine eyes.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And even as birds uprisen from the shore,</p>
<p class="slindent">As in congratulation o&rsquo;er their food,</p>
<p class="slindent">Make squadrons of themselves, now round, now long,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So from within those lights the holy creatures</p>
<p class="slindent">Sang flying to and fro, and in their figures</p>
<p class="slindent">Made of themselves now D, now I, now L.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>First singing they to their own music moved;</p>
<p class="slindent">Then one becoming of these characters,</p>
<p class="slindent">A little while they rested and were silent.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>O divine Pegasea, thou who genius</p>
<p class="slindent">Dost glorious make, and render it long-lived,</p>
<p class="slindent">And this through thee the cities and the kingdoms,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Illume me with thyself, that I may bring</p>
<p class="slindent">Their figures out as I have them conceived!</p>
<p class="slindent">Apparent be thy power in these brief verses!</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Themselves then they displayed in five times seven</p>
<p class="slindent">Vowels and consonants; and I observed</p>
<p class="slindent">The parts as they seemed spoken unto me.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&lsquo;Diligite justitiam,&rsquo; these were</p>
<p class="slindent">First verb and noun of all that was depicted;</p>
<p class="slindent">&lsquo;Qui judicatis terram&rsquo; were the last.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thereafter in the M of the fifth word</p>
<p class="slindent">Remained they so arranged, that Jupiter</p>
<p class="slindent">Seemed to be silver there with gold inlaid.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And other lights I saw descend where was</p>
<p class="slindent">The summit of the M, and pause there singing</p>
<p class="slindent">The good, I think, that draws them to itself.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then, as in striking upon burning logs</p>
<p class="slindent">Upward there fly innumerable sparks,</p>
<p class="slindent">Whence fools are wont to look for auguries,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>More than a thousand lights seemed thence to rise,</p>
<p class="slindent">And to ascend, some more, and others less,</p>
<p class="slindent">Even as the Sun that lights them had allotted;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And, each one being quiet in its place,</p>
<p class="slindent">The head and neck beheld I of an eagle</p>
<p class="slindent">Delineated by that inlaid fire.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>He who there paints has none to be his guide;</p>
<p class="slindent">But Himself guides; and is from Him remembered</p>
<p class="slindent">That virtue which is form unto the nest.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The other beatitude, that contented seemed</p>
<p class="slindent">At first to bloom a lily on the M,</p>
<p class="slindent">By a slight motion followed out the imprint.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>O gentle star! what and how many gems</p>
<p class="slindent">Did demonstrate to me, that all our justice</p>
<p class="slindent">Effect is of that heaven which thou ingemmest!</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Wherefore I pray the Mind, in which begin</p>
<p class="slindent">Thy motion and thy virtue, to regard</p>
<p class="slindent">Whence comes the smoke that vitiates thy rays;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So that a second time it now be wroth</p>
<p class="slindent">With buying and with selling in the temple</p>
<p class="slindent">Whose walls were built with signs and martyrdoms!</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>O soldiery of heaven, whom I contemplate,</p>
<p class="slindent">Implore for those who are upon the earth</p>
<p class="slindent">All gone astray after the bad example!</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Once &rsquo;twas the custom to make war with swords;</p>
<p class="slindent">But now &rsquo;tis made by taking here and there</p>
<p class="slindent">The bread the pitying Father shuts from none.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Yet thou, who writest but to cancel, think</p>
<p class="slindent">That Peter and that Paul, who for this vineyard</p>
<p class="slindent">Which thou art spoiling died, are still alive!</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Well canst thou say: &ldquo;So steadfast my desire</p>
<p class="slindent">Is unto him who willed to live alone,</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>That I know not the Fisherman nor Paul.&rdquo;</p></div>`,

`<p class="cantohead">Paradiso: Canto XIX</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>Appeared before me with its wings outspread</p>
<p class="slindent">The beautiful image that in sweet fruition</p>
<p class="slindent">Made jubilant the interwoven souls;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Appeared a little ruby each, wherein</p>
<p class="slindent">Ray of the sun was burning so enkindled</p>
<p class="slindent">That each into mine eyes refracted it.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And what it now behoves me to retrace</p>
<p class="slindent">Nor voice has e&rsquo;er reported, nor ink written,</p>
<p class="slindent">Nor was by fantasy e&rsquo;er comprehended;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>For speak I saw, and likewise heard, the beak,</p>
<p class="slindent">And utter with its voice both &lsquo;I&rsquo; and &lsquo;My,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">When in conception it was &lsquo;We&rsquo; and &lsquo;Our.&rsquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And it began: &ldquo;Being just and merciful</p>

<p class="slindent">Which cannot be exceeded by desire;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And upon earth I left my memory</p>
<p class="slindent">Such, that the evil-minded people there</p>
<p class="slindent">Commend it, but continue not the story.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So doth a single heat from many embers</p>
<p class="slindent">Make itself felt, even as from many loves</p>
<p class="slindent">Issued a single sound from out that image.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Whence I thereafter: &ldquo;O perpetual flowers</p>
<p class="slindent">Of the eternal joy, that only one</p>
<p class="slindent">Make me perceive your odours manifold,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Exhaling, break within me the great fast</p>
<p class="slindent">Which a long season has in hunger held me,</p>
<p class="slindent">Not finding for it any food on earth.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Well do I know, that if in heaven its mirror</p>
<p class="slindent">Justice Divine another realm doth make,</p>
<p class="slindent">Yours apprehends it not through any veil.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>You know how I attentively address me</p>
<p class="slindent">To listen; and you know what is the doubt</p>
<p class="slindent">That is in me so very old a fast.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Even as a falcon, issuing from his hood,</p>
<p class="slindent">Doth move his head, and with his wings applaud him,</p>
<p class="slindent">Showing desire, and making himself fine,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Saw I become that standard, which of lauds</p>
<p class="slindent">Was interwoven of the grace divine,</p>
<p class="slindent">With such songs as he knows who there rejoices.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then it began: &ldquo;He who a compass turned</p>
<p class="slindent">On the world&rsquo;s outer verge, and who within it</p>
<p class="slindent">Devised so much occult and manifest,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Could not the impress of his power so make</p>
<p class="slindent">On all the universe, as that his Word</p>
<p class="slindent">Should not remain in infinite excess.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And this makes certain that the first proud being,</p>
<p class="slindent">Who was the paragon of every creature,</p>
<p class="slindent">By not awaiting light fell immature.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And hence appears it, that each minor nature</p>
<p class="slindent">Is scant receptacle unto that good</p>
<p class="slindent">Which has no end, and by itself is measured.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>In consequence our vision, which perforce</p>
<p class="slindent">Must be some ray of that intelligence</p>
<p class="slindent">With which all things whatever are replete,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Cannot in its own nature be so potent,</p>
<p class="slindent">That it shall not its origin discern</p>
<p class="slindent">Far beyond that which is apparent to it.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Therefore into the justice sempiternal</p>
<p class="slindent">The power of vision that your world receives,</p>
<p class="slindent">As eye into the ocean, penetrates;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Which, though it see the bottom near the shore,</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>Amply to thee is opened now the cavern</p>
<p class="slindent">Which has concealed from thee the living justice</p>
<p class="slindent">Of which thou mad&rsquo;st such frequent questioning.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>For saidst thou: &lsquo;Born a man is on the shore</p>
<p class="slindent">Of Indus, and is none who there can speak</p>
<p class="slindent">Of Christ, nor who can read, nor who can write;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And all his inclinations and his actions</p>
<p class="slindent">Are good, so far as human reason sees,</p>
<p class="slindent">Without a sin in life or in discourse:</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>He dieth unbaptised and without faith;</p>
<p class="slindent">Where is this justice that condemneth him?</p>
<p class="slindent">Where is his fault, if he do not believe?&rsquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Now who art thou, that on the bench wouldst sit</p>
<p class="slindent">In judgment at a thousand miles away,</p>
<p class="slindent">With the short vision of a single span?</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Truly to him who with me subtilizes,</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>O animals terrene, O stolid minds,</p>
<p class="slindent">The primal will, that in itself is good,</p>
<p class="slindent">Ne&rsquo;er from itself, the Good Supreme, has moved.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So much is just as is accordant with it;</p>
<p class="slindent">No good created draws it to itself,</p>
<p class="slindent">But it, by raying forth, occasions that.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Even as above her nest goes circling round</p>
<p class="slindent">The stork when she has fed her little ones,</p>
<p class="slindent">And he who has been fed looks up at her,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So lifted I my brows, and even such</p>
<p class="slindent">Became the blessed image, which its wings</p>
<p class="slindent">Was moving, by so many counsels urged.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Circling around it sang, and said: &ldquo;As are</p>
<p class="slindent">My notes to thee, who dost not comprehend them,</p>
<p class="slindent">Such is the eternal judgment to you mortals.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Those lucent splendours of the Holy Spirit</p>
<p class="slindent">Grew quiet then, but still within the standard</p>
<p class="slindent">That made the Romans reverend to the world.</p></div>

<p class="slindent">Taketh its form, and as upon the vent</p>
<p class="slindent">Of rustic pipe the wind that enters it,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Even thus, relieved from the delay of waiting,</p>
<p class="slindent">That murmuring of the eagle mounted up</p>
<p class="slindent">Along its neck, as if it had been hollow.</p></div>

<p class="slindent">As doth the flaming manifest to thee.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But the high charity, that makes us servants</p>
<p class="slindent">Prompt to the counsel which controls the world,</p>
<p class="slindent">Allotteth here, even as thou dost observe.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;I see full well,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;O sacred lamp!</p>
<p class="slindent">How love unfettered in this court sufficeth</p>
<p class="slindent">To follow the eternal Providence;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But this is what seems hard for me to see,</p>
<p class="slindent">Wherefore predestinate wast thou alone</p>
<p class="slindent">Unto this office from among thy consorts.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>No sooner had I come to the last word,</p>
<p class="slindent">Than of its middle made the light a centre,</p>
<p class="slindent">Whirling itself about like a swift millstone.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>When answer made the love that was therein:</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;On me directed is a light divine,</p>
<p class="slindent">Piercing through this in which I am embosomed,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Of which the virtue with my sight conjoined</p>
<p class="slindent">Lifts me above myself so far, I see</p>
<p class="slindent">The supreme essence from which this is drawn.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Hence comes the joyfulness with which I flame,</p>
<p class="slindent">For to my sight, as far as it is clear,</p>
<p class="slindent">The clearness of the flame I equal make.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But that soul in the heaven which is most pure,</p>
<p class="slindent">That seraph which his eye on God most fixes,</p>
<p class="slindent">Could this demand of thine not satisfy;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Because so deeply sinks in the abyss</p>
<p class="slindent">Of the eternal statute what thou askest,</p>
<p class="slindent">From all created sight it is cut off.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And to the mortal world, when thou returnest,</p>
<p class="slindent">This carry back, that it may not presume</p>
<p class="slindent">Longer tow&rsquo;rd such a goal to move its feet.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The mind, that shineth here, on earth doth smoke;</p>
<p class="slindent">From this observe how can it do below</p>
<p class="slindent">That which it cannot though the heaven assume it?&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Such limit did its words prescribe to me,</p>
<p class="slindent">The question I relinquished, and restricted</p>
<p class="slindent">Myself to ask it humbly who it was.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Between two shores of Italy rise cliffs,</p>
<p class="slindent">And not far distant from thy native place,</p>
<p class="slindent">So high, the thunders far below them sound,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And form a ridge that Catria is called,</p>
<p class="slindent">&rsquo;Neath which is consecrate a hermitage</p>
<p class="slindent">Wont to be dedicate to worship only.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thus unto me the third speech recommenced,</p>
<p class="slindent">And then, continuing, it said: &ldquo;Therein</p>
<p class="slindent">Unto God&rsquo;s service I became so steadfast,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>That feeding only on the juice of olives</p>
<p class="slindent">Lightly I passed away the heats and frosts,</p>
<p class="slindent">Contented in my thoughts contemplative.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>That cloister used to render to these heavens</p>
<p class="slindent">Abundantly, and now is empty grown,</p>
<p class="slindent">So that perforce it soon must be revealed.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I in that place was Peter Damiano;</p>
<p class="slindent">And Peter the Sinner was I in the house</p>
<p class="slindent">Of Our Lady on the Adriatic shore.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Little of mortal life remained to me,</p>
<p class="slindent">When I was called and dragged forth to the hat</p>
<p class="slindent">Which shifteth evermore from bad to worse.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Came Cephas, and the mighty Vessel came</p>
<p class="slindent">Of the Holy Spirit, meagre and barefooted,</p>
<p class="slindent">Taking the food of any hostelry.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Now some one to support them on each side</p>
<p class="slindent">The modern shepherds need, and some to lead them,</p>
<p class="slindent">So heavy are they, and to hold their trains.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>They cover up their palfreys with their cloaks,</p>
<p class="slindent">So that two beasts go underneath one skin;</p>
<p class="slindent">O Patience, that dost tolerate so much!&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>At this voice saw I many little flames</p>
<p class="slindent">From step to step descending and revolving,</p>
<p class="slindent">And every revolution made them fairer.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Round about this one came they and stood still,</p>
<p class="slindent">And a cry uttered of so loud a sound,</p>
<p class="slindent">It here could find no parallel, nor I</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Distinguished it, the thunder so o&rsquo;ercame me.</p></div>`,

`<p class="cantohead">Paradiso: Canto XXII</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>Oppressed with stupor, I unto my guide</p>
<p class="slindent">Turned like a little child who always runs</p>
<p class="slindent">For refuge there where he confideth most;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And she, even as a mother who straightway</p>
<p class="slindent">Gives comfort to her pale and breathless boy</p>
<p class="slindent">With voice whose wont it is to reassure him,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Said to me: &ldquo;Knowest thou not thou art in heaven,</p>
<p class="slindent">And knowest thou not that heaven is holy all</p>
<p class="slindent">And what is done here cometh from good zeal?</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>After what wise the singing would have changed thee</p>
<p class="slindent">And I by smiling, thou canst now imagine,</p>
<p class="slindent">Since that the cry has startled thee so much,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>In which if thou hadst understood its prayers</p>
<p class="slindent">Already would be known to thee the vengeance</p>
<p class="slindent">Which thou shalt look upon before thou diest.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The sword above here smiteth not in haste</p>
<p class="slindent">Nor tardily, howe&rsquo;er it seem to him</p>
<p class="slindent">Who fearing or desiring waits for it.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But turn thee round towards the others now,</p>
<p class="slindent">For very illustrious spirits shalt thou see,</p>
<p class="slindent">If thou thy sight directest as I say.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>As it seemed good to her mine eyes I turned,</p>
<p class="slindent">And saw a hundred spherules that together</p>
<p class="slindent">With mutual rays each other more embellished.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I stood as one who in himself represses</p>
<p class="slindent">The point of his desire, and ventures not</p>
<p class="slindent">To question, he so feareth the too much.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And now the largest and most luculent</p>
<p class="slindent">Among those pearls came forward, that it might</p>
<p class="slindent">Make my desire concerning it content.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Within it then I heard: &ldquo;If thou couldst see</p>
<p class="slindent">Even as myself the charity that burns</p>
<p class="slindent">Among us, thy conceits would be expressed;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But, that by waiting thou mayst not come late</p>
<p class="slindent">To the high end, I will make answer even</p>
<p class="slindent">Unto the thought of which thou art so chary.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>That mountain on whose slope Cassino stands</p>
<p class="slindent">Was frequented of old upon its summit</p>
<p class="slindent">By a deluded folk and ill-disposed;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And I am he who first up thither bore</p>
<p class="slindent">The name of Him who brought upon the earth</p>
<p class="slindent">The truth that so much sublimateth us.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And such abundant grace upon me shone</p>
<p class="slindent">That all the neighbouring towns I drew away</p>
<p class="slindent">From the impious worship that seduced the world.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>These other fires, each one of them, were men</p>
<p class="slindent">Contemplative, enkindled by that heat</p>
<p class="slindent">Which maketh holy flowers and fruits spring up.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Here is Macarius, here is Romualdus,</p>
<p class="slindent">Here are my brethren, who within the cloisters</p>
<p class="slindent">Their footsteps stayed and kept a steadfast heart.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And I to him: &ldquo;The affection which thou showest</p>
<p class="slindent">Speaking with me, and the good countenance</p>
<p class="slindent">Which I behold and note in all your ardours,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>In me have so my confidence dilated</p>
<p class="slindent">As the sun doth the rose, when it becomes</p>
<p class="slindent">As far unfolded as it hath the power.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Therefore I pray, and thou assure me, father,</p>
<p class="slindent">If I may so much grace receive, that I</p>
<p class="slindent">May thee behold with countenance unveiled.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>He thereupon: &ldquo;Brother, thy high desire</p>
<p class="slindent">In the remotest sphere shall be fulfilled,</p>
<p class="slindent">Where are fulfilled all others and my own.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>There perfect is, and ripened, and complete,</p>
<p class="slindent">Every desire; within that one alone</p>
<p class="slindent">Is every part where it has always been;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>For it is not in space, nor turns on poles,</p>
<p class="slindent">And unto it our stairway reaches up,</p>
<p class="slindent">Whence thus from out thy sight it steals away.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Up to that height the Patriarch Jacob saw it</p>
<p class="slindent">Extending its supernal part, what time</p>
<p class="slindent">So thronged with angels it appeared to him.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But to ascend it now no one uplifts</p>
<p class="slindent">His feet from off the earth, and now my Rule</p>
<p class="slindent">Below remaineth for mere waste of paper.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The walls that used of old to be an Abbey</p>
<p class="slindent">Are changed to dens of robbers, and the cowls</p>
<p class="slindent">Are sacks filled full of miserable flour.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But heavy usury is not taken up</p>
<p class="slindent">So much against God&rsquo;s pleasure as that fruit</p>
<p class="slindent">Which maketh so insane the heart of monks;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>For whatsoever hath the Church in keeping</p>
<p class="slindent">Is for the folk that ask it in God&rsquo;s name,</p>
<p class="slindent">Not for one&rsquo;s kindred or for something worse.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The flesh of mortals is so very soft,</p>
<p class="slindent">That good beginnings down below suffice not</p>
<p class="slindent">From springing of the oak to bearing acorns.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Peter began with neither gold nor silver,</p>
<p class="slindent">And I with orison and abstinence,</p>
<p class="slindent">And Francis with humility his convent.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And if thou lookest at each one&rsquo;s beginning,</p>
<p class="slindent">And then regardest whither he has run,</p>
<p class="slindent">Thou shalt behold the white changed into brown.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>In verity the Jordan backward turned,</p>
<p class="slindent">And the sea&rsquo;s fleeing, when God willed were more</p>
<p class="slindent">A wonder to behold, than succour here.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thus unto me he said; and then withdrew</p>
<p class="slindent">To his own band, and the band closed together;</p>
<p class="slindent">Then like a whirlwind all was upward rapt.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The gentle Lady urged me on behind them</p>
<p class="slindent">Up o&rsquo;er that stairway by a single sign,</p>
<p class="slindent">So did her virtue overcome my nature;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Nor here below, where one goes up and down</p>
<p class="slindent">By natural law, was motion e&rsquo;er so swift</p>
<p class="slindent">That it could be compared unto my wing.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Reader, as I may unto that devout</p>
<p class="slindent">Triumph return, on whose account I often</p>
<p class="slindent">For my transgressions weep and beat my breast,—</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thou hadst not thrust thy finger in the fire</p>
<p class="slindent">And drawn it out again, before I saw</p>
<p class="slindent">The sign that follows Taurus, and was in it.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>O glorious stars, O light impregnated</p>
<p class="slindent">With mighty virtue, from which I acknowledge</p>
<p class="slindent">All of my genius, whatsoe&rsquo;er it be,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>With you was born, and hid himself with you,</p>
<p class="slindent">He who is father of all mortal life,</p>
<p class="slindent">When first I tasted of the Tuscan air;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And then when grace was freely given to me</p>
<p class="slindent">To enter the high wheel which turns you round,</p>
<p class="slindent">Your region was allotted unto me.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>To you devoutly at this hour my soul</p>
<p class="slindent">Is sighing, that it virtue may acquire</p>
<p class="slindent">For the stern pass that draws it to itself.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Thou art so near unto the last salvation,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Thus Beatrice began, &ldquo;thou oughtest now</p>
<p class="slindent">To have thine eves unclouded and acute;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And therefore, ere thou enter farther in,</p>
<p class="slindent">Look down once more, and see how vast a world</p>
<p class="slindent">Thou hast already put beneath thy feet;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So that thy heart, as jocund as it may,</p>
<p class="slindent">Present itself to the triumphant throng</p>
<p class="slindent">That comes rejoicing through this rounded ether.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I with my sight returned through one and all</p>
<p class="slindent">The sevenfold spheres, and I beheld this globe</p>
<p class="slindent">Such that I smiled at its ignoble semblance;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And that opinion I approve as best</p>
<p class="slindent">Which doth account it least; and he who thinks</p>
<p class="slindent">Of something else may truly be called just.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I saw the daughter of Latona shining</p>
<p class="slindent">Without that shadow, which to me was cause</p>
<p class="slindent">That once I had believed her rare and dense.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The aspect of thy son, Hyperion,</p>
<p class="slindent">Here I sustained, and saw how move themselves</p>
<p class="slindent">Around and near him Maia and Dione.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thence there appeared the temperateness of Jove</p>
<p class="slindent">&rsquo;Twixt son and father, and to me was clear</p>
<p class="slindent">The change that of their whereabout they make;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And all the seven made manifest to me</p>
<p class="slindent">How great they are, and eke how swift they are,</p>
<p class="slindent">And how they are in distant habitations.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The threshing-floor that maketh us so proud,</p>
<p class="slindent">To me revolving with the eternal Twins,</p>
<p class="slindent">Was all apparent made from hill to harbour!</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then to the beauteous eyes mine eyes I turned.</p></div>`,

`<p class="cantohead">Paradiso: Canto XXIII</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>Even as a bird, &rsquo;mid the beloved leaves,</p>
<p class="slindent">Quiet upon the nest of her sweet brood</p>
<p class="slindent">Throughout the night, that hideth all things from us,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Who, that she may behold their longed-for looks</p>
<p class="slindent">And find the food wherewith to nourish them,</p>
<p class="slindent">In which, to her, grave labours grateful are,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Anticipates the time on open spray</p>
<p class="slindent">And with an ardent longing waits the sun,</p>
<p class="slindent">Gazing intent as soon as breaks the dawn:</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Even thus my Lady standing was, erect</p>
<p class="slindent">And vigilant, turned round towards the zone</p>
<p class="slindent">Underneath which the sun displays less haste;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So that beholding her distraught and wistful,</p>
<p class="slindent">Such I became as he is who desiring</p>
<p class="slindent">For something yearns, and hoping is appeased.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But brief the space from one When to the other;</p>
<p class="slindent">Of my awaiting, say I, and the seeing</p>
<p class="slindent">The welkin grow resplendent more and more.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And Beatrice exclaimed: &ldquo;Behold the hosts</p>
<p class="slindent">Of Christ&rsquo;s triumphal march, and all the fruit</p>
<p class="slindent">Harvested by the rolling of these spheres!&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>It seemed to me her face was all aflame;</p>
<p class="slindent">And eyes she had so full of ecstasy</p>
<p class="slindent">That I must needs pass on without describing.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>As when in nights serene of the full moon</p>
<p class="slindent">Smiles Trivia among the nymphs eternal</p>
<p class="slindent">Who paint the firmament through all its gulfs,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Saw I, above the myriads of lamps,</p>
<p class="slindent">A Sun that one and all of them enkindled,</p>
<p class="slindent">E&rsquo;en as our own doth the supernal sights,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And through the living light transparent shone</p>
<p class="slindent">The lucent substance so intensely clear</p>
<p class="slindent">Into my sight, that I sustained it not.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>O Beatrice, thou gentle guide and dear!</p>
<p class="slindent">To me she said: &ldquo;What overmasters thee</p>
<p class="slindent">A virtue is from which naught shields itself.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>There are the wisdom and the omnipotence</p>
<p class="slindent">That oped the thoroughfares &rsquo;twixt heaven and earth,</p>
<p class="slindent">For which there erst had been so long a yearning.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>As fire from out a cloud unlocks itself,</p>
<p class="slindent">Dilating so it finds not room therein,</p>
<p class="slindent">And down, against its nature, falls to earth,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So did my mind, among those aliments</p>
<p class="slindent">Becoming larger, issue from itself,</p>
<p class="slindent">And that which it became cannot remember.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Open thine eyes, and look at what I am:</p>
<p class="slindent">Thou hast beheld such things, that strong enough</p>
<p class="slindent">Hast thou become to tolerate my smile.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I was as one who still retains the feeling</p>
<p class="slindent">Of a forgotten vision, and endeavours</p>
<p class="slindent">In vain to bring it back into his mind,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>When I this invitation heard, deserving</p>
<p class="slindent">Of so much gratitude, it never fades</p>
<p class="slindent">Out of the book that chronicles the past.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>If at this moment sounded all the tongues</p>
<p class="slindent">That Polyhymnia and her sisters made</p>
<p class="slindent">Most lubrical with their delicious milk,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>To aid me, to a thousandth of the truth</p>
<p class="slindent">It would not reach, singing the holy smile</p>
<p class="slindent">And how the holy aspect it illumed.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And therefore, representing Paradise,</p>
<p class="slindent">The sacred poem must perforce leap over,</p>
<p class="slindent">Even as a man who finds his way cut off;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But whoso thinketh of the ponderous theme,</p>
<p class="slindent">And of the mortal shoulder laden with it,</p>
<p class="slindent">Should blame it not, if under this it tremble.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>It is no passage for a little boat</p>
<p class="slindent">This which goes cleaving the audacious prow,</p>
<p class="slindent">Nor for a pilot who would spare himself.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Why doth my face so much enamour thee,</p>
<p class="slindent">That to the garden fair thou turnest not,</p>
<p class="slindent">Which under the rays of Christ is blossoming?</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>There is the Rose in which the Word Divine</p>
<p class="slindent">Became incarnate; there the lilies are</p>
<p class="slindent">By whose perfume the good way was discovered.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thus Beatrice; and I, who to her counsels</p>
<p class="slindent">Was wholly ready, once again betook me</p>
<p class="slindent">Unto the battle of the feeble brows.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>As in the sunshine, that unsullied streams</p>
<p class="slindent">Through fractured cloud, ere now a meadow of flowers</p>
<p class="slindent">Mine eyes with shadow covered o&rsquo;er have seen,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So troops of splendours manifold I saw</p>
<p class="slindent">Illumined from above with burning rays,</p>
<p class="slindent">Beholding not the source of the effulgence.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>O power benignant that dost so imprint them!</p>
<p class="slindent">Thou didst exalt thyself to give more scope</p>
<p class="slindent">There to mine eyes, that were not strong enough.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The name of that fair flower I e&rsquo;er invoke</p>
<p class="slindent">Morning and evening utterly enthralled</p>
<p class="slindent">My soul to gaze upon the greater fire.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And when in both mine eyes depicted were</p>
<p class="slindent">The glory and greatness of the living star</p>
<p class="slindent">Which there excelleth, as it here excelled,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Athwart the heavens a little torch descended</p>
<p class="slindent">Formed in a circle like a coronal,</p>
<p class="slindent">And cinctured it, and whirled itself about it.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Whatever melody most sweetly soundeth</p>
<p class="slindent">On earth, and to itself most draws the soul,</p>
<p class="slindent">Would seem a cloud that, rent asunder, thunders,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Compared unto the sounding of that lyre</p>
<p class="slindent">Wherewith was crowned the sapphire beautiful,</p>
<p class="slindent">Which gives the clearest heaven its sapphire hue.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;I am Angelic Love, that circle round</p>
<p class="slindent">The joy sublime which breathes from out the womb</p>
<p class="slindent">That was the hostelry of our Desire;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And I shall circle, Lady of Heaven, while</p>
<p class="slindent">Thou followest thy Son, and mak&rsquo;st diviner</p>
<p class="slindent">The sphere supreme, because thou enterest there.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thus did the circulated melody</p>
<p class="slindent">Seal itself up; and all the other lights</p>
<p class="slindent">Were making to resound the name of Mary.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The regal mantle of the volumes all</p>
<p class="slindent">Of that world, which most fervid is and living</p>
<p class="slindent">With breath of God and with his works and ways,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Extended over us its inner border,</p>
<p class="slindent">So very distant, that the semblance of it</p>
<p class="slindent">There where I was not yet appeared to me.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Therefore mine eyes did not possess the power</p>
<p class="slindent">Of following the incoronated flame,</p>
<p class="slindent">Which mounted upward near to its own seed.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And as a little child, that towards its mother</p>
<p class="slindent">Stretches its arms, when it the milk has taken,</p>
<p class="slindent">Through impulse kindled into outward flame,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Each of those gleams of whiteness upward reached</p>
<p class="slindent">So with its summit, that the deep affection</p>
<p class="slindent">They had for Mary was revealed to me.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thereafter they remained there in my sight,</p>
<p class="slindent">&lsquo;Regina coeli&rsquo; singing with such sweetness,</p>
<p class="slindent">That ne&rsquo;er from me has the delight departed.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>O, what exuberance is garnered up</p>
<p class="slindent">Within those richest coffers, which had been</p>
<p class="slindent">Good husbandmen for sowing here below!</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>There they enjoy and live upon the treasure</p>
<p class="slindent">Which was acquired while weeping in the exile</p>
<p class="slindent">Of Babylon, wherein the gold was left.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>There triumpheth, beneath the exalted Son</p>
<p class="slindent">Of God and Mary, in his victory,</p>
<p class="slindent">Both with the ancient council and the new,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>He who doth keep the keys of such a glory.</p></div>`,

`<p class="cantohead">Paradiso: Canto XXIV</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;O company elect to the great supper</p>
<p class="slindent">Of the Lamb benedight, who feedeth you</p>
<p class="slindent">So that for ever full is your desire,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>If by the grace of God this man foretaste</p>
<p class="slindent">Something of that which falleth from your table,</p>
<p class="slindent">Or ever death prescribe to him the time,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Direct your mind to his immense desire,</p>
<p class="slindent">And him somewhat bedew; ye drinking are</p>
<p class="slindent">For ever at the fount whence comes his thought.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thus Beatrice; and those souls beatified</p>
<p class="slindent">Transformed themselves to spheres on steadfast poles,</p>
<p class="slindent">Flaming intensely in the guise of comets.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And as the wheels in works of horologes</p>
<p class="slindent">Revolve so that the first to the beholder</p>
<p class="slindent">Motionless seems, and the last one to fly,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So in like manner did those carols, dancing</p>
<p class="slindent">In different measure, of their affluence</p>
<p class="slindent">Give me the gauge, as they were swift or slow.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>From that one which I noted of most beauty</p>
<p class="slindent">Beheld I issue forth a fire so happy</p>
<p class="slindent">That none it left there of a greater brightness;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And around Beatrice three several times</p>
<p class="slindent">It whirled itself with so divine a song,</p>
<p class="slindent">My fantasy repeats it not to me;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Therefore the pen skips, and I write it not,</p>
<p class="slindent">Since our imagination for such folds,</p>
<p class="slindent">Much more our speech, is of a tint too glaring.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;O holy sister mine, who us implorest</p>
<p class="slindent">With such devotion, by thine ardent love</p>
<p class="slindent">Thou dost unbind me from that beautiful sphere!&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thereafter, having stopped, the blessed fire</p>
<p class="slindent">Unto my Lady did direct its breath,</p>
<p class="slindent">Which spake in fashion as I here have said.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And she: &ldquo;O light eterne of the great man</p>
<p class="slindent">To whom our Lord delivered up the keys</p>
<p class="slindent">He carried down of this miraculous joy,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>This one examine on points light and grave,</p>
<p class="slindent">As good beseemeth thee, about the Faith</p>
<p class="slindent">By means of which thou on the sea didst walk.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>If he love well, and hope well, and believe,</p>
<p class="slindent">From thee &rsquo;tis hid not; for thou hast thy sight</p>
<p class="slindent">There where depicted everything is seen.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But since this kingdom has made citizens</p>
<p class="slindent">By means of the true Faith, to glorify it</p>
<p class="slindent">&rsquo;Tis well he have the chance to speak thereof.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>As baccalaureate arms himself, and speaks not</p>
<p class="slindent">Until the master doth propose the question,</p>
<p class="slindent">To argue it, and not to terminate it,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So did I arm myself with every reason,</p>
<p class="slindent">While she was speaking, that I might be ready</p>
<p class="slindent">For such a questioner and such profession.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Say, thou good Christian; manifest thyself;</p>
<p class="slindent">What is the Faith?&rdquo;  Whereat I raised my brow</p>
<p class="slindent">Unto that light wherefrom was this breathed forth.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then turned I round to Beatrice, and she</p>
<p class="slindent">Prompt signals made to me that I should pour</p>
<p class="slindent">The water forth from my internal fountain.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;May grace, that suffers me to make confession,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Began I, &ldquo;to the great centurion,</p>
<p class="slindent">Cause my conceptions all to be explicit!&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And I continued: &ldquo;As the truthful pen,</p>
<p class="slindent">Father, of thy dear brother wrote of it,</p>
<p class="slindent">Who put with thee Rome into the good way,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Faith is the substance of the things we hope for,</p>
<p class="slindent">And evidence of those that are not seen;</p>
<p class="slindent">And this appears to me its quiddity.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then heard I: &ldquo;Very rightly thou perceivest,</p>
<p class="slindent">If well thou understandest why he placed it</p>
<p class="slindent">With substances and then with evidences.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And I thereafterward: &ldquo;The things profound,</p>
<p class="slindent">That here vouchsafe to me their apparition,</p>
<p class="slindent">Unto all eyes below are so concealed,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>That they exist there only in belief,</p>
<p class="slindent">Upon the which is founded the high hope,</p>
<p class="slindent">And hence it takes the nature of a substance.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And it behoveth us from this belief</p>
<p class="slindent">To reason without having other sight,</p>
<p class="slindent">And hence it has the nature of evidence.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then heard I: &ldquo;If whatever is acquired</p>
<p class="slindent">Below by doctrine were thus understood,</p>
<p class="slindent">No sophist&rsquo;s subtlety would there find place.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thus was breathed forth from that enkindled love;</p>
<p class="slindent">Then added: &ldquo;Very well has been gone over</p>
<p class="slindent">Already of this coin the alloy and weight;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But tell me if thou hast it in thy purse?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">And I: &ldquo;Yes, both so shining and so round</p>
<p class="slindent">That in its stamp there is no peradventure.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thereafter issued from the light profound</p>
<p class="slindent">That there resplendent was: &ldquo;This precious jewel,</p>
<p class="slindent">Upon the which is every virtue founded,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Whence hadst thou it?&rdquo;  And I: &ldquo;The large outpouring</p>
<p class="slindent">Of Holy Spirit, which has been diffused</p>
<p class="slindent">Upon the ancient parchments and the new,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>A syllogism is, which proved it to me</p>
<p class="slindent">With such acuteness, that, compared therewith,</p>
<p class="slindent">All demonstration seems to me obtuse.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And then I heard: &ldquo;The ancient and the new</p>
<p class="slindent">Postulates, that to thee are so conclusive,</p>
<p class="slindent">Why dost thou take them for the word divine?&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And I: &ldquo;The proofs, which show the truth to me,</p>
<p class="slindent">Are the works subsequent, whereunto Nature</p>
<p class="slindent">Ne&rsquo;er heated iron yet, nor anvil beat.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&rsquo;Twas answered me: &ldquo;Say, who assureth thee</p>
<p class="slindent">That those works ever were? the thing itself</p>
<p class="slindent">That must be proved, nought else to thee affirms it.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Were the world to Christianity converted,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">I said, &ldquo;withouten miracles, this one</p>
<p class="slindent">Is such, the rest are not its hundredth part;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Because that poor and fasting thou didst enter</p>
<p class="slindent">Into the field to sow there the good plant,</p>
<p class="slindent">Which was a vine and has become a thorn!&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>This being finished, the high, holy Court</p>
<p class="slindent">Resounded through the spheres, &ldquo;One God we praise!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">In melody that there above is chanted.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And then that Baron, who from branch to branch,</p>
<p class="slindent">Examining, had thus conducted me,</p>
<p class="slindent">Till the extremest leaves we were approaching,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Again began: &ldquo;The Grace that dallying</p>
<p class="slindent">Plays with thine intellect thy mouth has opened,</p>
<p class="slindent">Up to this point, as it should opened be,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So that I do approve what forth emerged;</p>
<p class="slindent">But now thou must express what thou believest,</p>
<p class="slindent">And whence to thy belief it was presented.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;O holy father, spirit who beholdest</p>
<p class="slindent">What thou believedst so that thou o&rsquo;ercamest,</p>
<p class="slindent">Towards the sepulchre, more youthful feet,&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Began I, &ldquo;thou dost wish me in this place</p>
<p class="slindent">The form to manifest of my prompt belief,</p>
<p class="slindent">And likewise thou the cause thereof demandest.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And I respond: In one God I believe,</p>
<p class="slindent">Sole and eterne, who moveth all the heavens</p>
<p class="slindent">With love and with desire, himself unmoved;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And of such faith not only have I proofs</p>
<p class="slindent">Physical and metaphysical, but gives them</p>
<p class="slindent">Likewise the truth that from this place rains down</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Through Moses, through the Prophets and the Psalms,</p>
<p class="slindent">Through the Evangel, and through you, who wrote</p>
<p class="slindent">After the fiery Spirit sanctified you;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>In Persons three eterne believe, and these</p>
<p class="slindent">One essence I believe, so one and trine</p>
<p class="slindent">They bear conjunction both with &lsquo;sunt&rsquo; and &lsquo;est.&rsquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>With the profound condition and divine</p>
<p class="slindent">Which now I touch upon, doth stamp my mind</p>
<p class="slindent">Ofttimes the doctrine evangelical.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>This the beginning is, this is the spark</p>
<p class="slindent">Which afterwards dilates to vivid flame,</p>
<p class="slindent">And, like a star in heaven, is sparkling in me.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Even as a lord who hears what pleaseth him</p>
<p class="slindent">His servant straight embraces, gratulating</p>
<p class="slindent">For the good news as soon as he is silent;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So, giving me its benediction, singing,</p>
<p class="slindent">Three times encircled me, when I was silent,</p>
<p class="slindent">The apostolic light, at whose command</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I spoken had, in speaking I so pleased him.</p></div>`,

`<p class="cantohead">Paradiso: Canto XXV</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>If e&rsquo;er it happen that the Poem Sacred,</p>
<p class="slindent">To which both heaven and earth have set their hand,</p>
<p class="slindent">So that it many a year hath made me lean,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>O&rsquo;ercome the cruelty that bars me out</p>
<p class="slindent">From the fair sheepfold, where a lamb I slumbered,</p>
<p class="slindent">An enemy to the wolves that war upon it,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>With other voice forthwith, with other fleece</p>
<p class="slindent">Poet will I return, and at my font</p>
<p class="slindent">Baptismal will I take the laurel crown;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Because into the Faith that maketh known</p>
<p class="slindent">All souls to God there entered I, and then</p>
<p class="slindent">Peter for her sake thus my brow encircled.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thereafterward towards us moved a light</p>
<p class="slindent">Out of that band whence issued the first-fruits</p>
<p class="slindent">Which of his vicars Christ behind him left,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And then my Lady, full of ecstasy,</p>
<p class="slindent">Said unto me: &ldquo;Look, look! behold the Baron</p>
<p class="slindent">For whom below Galicia is frequented.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>In the same way as, when a dove alights</p>
<p class="slindent">Near his companion, both of them pour forth,</p>
<p class="slindent">Circling about and murmuring, their affection,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So one beheld I by the other grand</p>
<p class="slindent">Prince glorified to be with welcome greeted,</p>
<p class="slindent">Lauding the food that there above is eaten.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But when their gratulations were complete,</p>
<p class="slindent">Silently &lsquo;coram me&rsquo; each one stood still,</p>
<p class="slindent">So incandescent it o&rsquo;ercame my sight.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Smiling thereafterwards, said Beatrice:</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Illustrious life, by whom the benefactions</p>
<p class="slindent">Of our Basilica have been described,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Make Hope resound within this altitude;</p>
<p class="slindent">Thou knowest as oft thou dost personify it</p>
<p class="slindent">As Jesus to the three gave greater clearness.&rdquo;&mdash;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Lift up thy head, and make thyself assured;</p>
<p class="slindent">For what comes hither from the mortal world</p>
<p class="slindent">Must needs be ripened in our radiance.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>This comfort came to me from the second fire;</p>
<p class="slindent">Wherefore mine eyes I lifted to the hills,</p>
<p class="slindent">Which bent them down before with too great weight.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Since, through his grace, our Emperor wills that thou</p>
<p class="slindent">Shouldst find thee face to face, before thy death,</p>
<p class="slindent">In the most secret chamber, with his Counts,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So that, the truth beholden of this court,</p>
<p class="slindent">Hope, which below there rightfully enamours,</p>
<p class="slindent">Thereby thou strengthen in thyself and others,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Say what it is, and how is flowering with it</p>
<p class="slindent">Thy mind, and say from whence it came to thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Thus did the second light again continue.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And the Compassionate, who piloted</p>
<p class="slindent">The plumage of my wings in such high flight,</p>
<p class="slindent">Did in reply anticipate me thus:</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;No child whatever the Church Militant</p>
<p class="slindent">Of greater hope possesses, as is written</p>
<p class="slindent">In that Sun which irradiates all our band;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Therefore it is conceded him from Egypt</p>
<p class="slindent">To come into Jerusalem to see,</p>
<p class="slindent">Or ever yet his warfare be completed.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The two remaining points, that not for knowledge</p>
<p class="slindent">Have been demanded, but that he report</p>
<p class="slindent">How much this virtue unto thee is pleasing,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>To him I leave; for hard he will not find them,</p>
<p class="slindent">Nor of self-praise; and let him answer them;</p>
<p class="slindent">And may the grace of God in this assist him!&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>As a disciple, who his teacher follows,</p>
<p class="slindent">Ready and willing, where he is expert,</p>
<p class="slindent">That his proficiency may be displayed,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Hope,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;is the certain expectation</p>
<p class="slindent">Of future glory, which is the effect</p>
<p class="slindent">Of grace divine and merit precedent.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>From many stars this light comes unto me;</p>
<p class="slindent">But he instilled it first into my heart</p>
<p class="slindent">Who was chief singer unto the chief captain.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&lsquo;Sperent in te,&rsquo; in the high Theody</p>
<p class="slindent">He sayeth, &rsquo;those who know thy name;&rsquo; and who</p>
<p class="slindent">Knoweth it not, if he my faith possess?</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thou didst instil me, then, with his instilling</p>
<p class="slindent">In the Epistle, so that I am full,</p>
<p class="slindent">And upon others rain again your rain.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>While I was speaking, in the living bosom</p>
<p class="slindent">Of that combustion quivered an effulgence,</p>
<p class="slindent">Sudden and frequent, in the guise of lightning;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then breathed: &ldquo;The love wherewith I am inflamed</p>
<p class="slindent">Towards the virtue still which followed me</p>
<p class="slindent">Unto the palm and issue of the field,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Wills that I breathe to thee that thou delight</p>
<p class="slindent">In her; and grateful to me is thy telling</p>
<p class="slindent">Whatever things Hope promises to thee.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And I: &ldquo;The ancient Scriptures and the new</p>
<p class="slindent">The mark establish, and this shows it me,</p>
<p class="slindent">Of all the souls whom God hath made his friends.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Isaiah saith, that each one garmented</p>
<p class="slindent">In his own land shall be with twofold garments,</p>
<p class="slindent">And his own land is this delightful life.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thy brother, too, far more explicitly,</p>
<p class="slindent">There where he treateth of the robes of white,</p>
<p class="slindent">This revelation manifests to us.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And first, and near the ending of these words,</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Sperent in te&rdquo; from over us was heard,</p>
<p class="slindent">To which responsive answered all the carols.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thereafterward a light among them brightened,</p>
<p class="slindent">So that, if Cancer one such crystal had,</p>
<p class="slindent">Winter would have a month of one sole day.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And as uprises, goes, and enters the dance</p>
<p class="slindent">A winsome maiden, only to do honour</p>
<p class="slindent">To the new bride, and not from any failing,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Even thus did I behold the brightened splendour</p>
<p class="slindent">Approach the two, who in a wheel revolved</p>
<p class="slindent">As was beseeming to their ardent love.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Into the song and music there it entered;</p>
<p class="slindent">And fixed on them my Lady kept her look,</p>
<p class="slindent">Even as a bride silent and motionless.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;This is the one who lay upon the breast</p>
<p class="slindent">Of him our Pelican; and this is he</p>
<p class="slindent">To the great office from the cross elected.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>My Lady thus; but therefore none the more</p>
<p class="slindent">Did move her sight from its attentive gaze</p>
<p class="slindent">Before or afterward these words of hers.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Even as a man who gazes, and endeavours</p>
<p class="slindent">To see the eclipsing of the sun a little,</p>
<p class="slindent">And who, by seeing, sightless doth become,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So I became before that latest fire,</p>
<p class="slindent">While it was said, &ldquo;Why dost thou daze thyself</p>
<p class="slindent">To see a thing which here hath no existence?</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Earth in the earth my body is, and shall be</p>
<p class="slindent">With all the others there, until our number</p>
<p class="slindent">With the eternal proposition tallies.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>With the two garments in the blessed cloister</p>
<p class="slindent">Are the two lights alone that have ascended:</p>
<p class="slindent">And this shalt thou take back into your world.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And at this utterance the flaming circle</p>
<p class="slindent">Grew quiet, with the dulcet intermingling</p>
<p class="slindent">Of sound that by the trinal breath was made,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>As to escape from danger or fatigue</p>
<p class="slindent">The oars that erst were in the water beaten</p>
<p class="slindent">Are all suspended at a whistle&rsquo;s sound.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Ah, how much in my mind was I disturbed,</p>
<p class="slindent">When I turned round to look on Beatrice,</p>
<p class="slindent">That her I could not see, although I was</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Close at her side and in the Happy World!</p></div>`,

`<p class="cantohead">Paradiso: Canto XXVI</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>While I was doubting for my vision quenched,</p>
<p class="slindent">Out of the flame refulgent that had quenched it</p>
<p class="slindent">Issued a breathing, that attentive made me,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Saying: &ldquo;While thou recoverest the sense</p>
<p class="slindent">Of seeing which in me thou hast consumed,</p>
<p class="slindent">&rsquo;Tis well that speaking thou shouldst compensate it.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Begin then, and declare to what thy soul</p>
<p class="slindent">Is aimed, and count it for a certainty,</p>
<p class="slindent">Sight is in thee bewildered and not dead;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Because the Lady, who through this divine</p>
<p class="slindent">Region conducteth thee, has in her look</p>
<p class="slindent">The power the hand of Ananias had.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I said: &ldquo;As pleaseth her, or soon or late</p>
<p class="slindent">Let the cure come to eyes that portals were</p>
<p class="slindent">When she with fire I ever burn with entered.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The Good, that gives contentment to this Court,</p>
<p class="slindent">The Alpha and Omega is of all</p>
<p class="slindent">The writing that love reads me low or loud.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The selfsame voice, that taken had from me</p>
<p class="slindent">The terror of the sudden dazzlement,</p>
<p class="slindent">To speak still farther put it in my thought;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And said: &ldquo;In verity with finer sieve</p>
<p class="slindent">Behoveth thee to sift; thee it behoveth</p>
<p class="slindent">To say who aimed thy bow at such a target.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And I: &ldquo;By philosophic arguments,</p>
<p class="slindent">And by authority that hence descends,</p>
<p class="slindent">Such love must needs imprint itself in me;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>For Good, so far as good, when comprehended</p>
<p class="slindent">Doth straight enkindle love, and so much greater</p>
<p class="slindent">As more of goodness in itself it holds;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then to that Essence (whose is such advantage</p>
<p class="slindent">That every good which out of it is found</p>
<p class="slindent">Is nothing but a ray of its own light)</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>More than elsewhither must the mind be moved</p>
<p class="slindent">Of every one, in loving, who discerns</p>
<p class="slindent">The truth in which this evidence is founded.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Such truth he to my intellect reveals</p>
<p class="slindent">Who demonstrates to me the primal love</p>
<p class="slindent">Of all the sempiternal substances.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The voice reveals it of the truthful Author,</p>
<p class="slindent">Who says to Moses, speaking of Himself,</p>
<p class="slindent">&lsquo;I will make all my goodness pass before thee.&rsquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thou too revealest it to me, beginning</p>
<p class="slindent">The loud Evangel, that proclaims the secret</p>
<p class="slindent">Of heaven to earth above all other edict.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And I heard say: &ldquo;By human intellect</p>
<p class="slindent">And by authority concordant with it,</p>
<p class="slindent">Of all thy loves reserve for God the highest.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But say again if other cords thou feelest,</p>
<p class="slindent">Draw thee towards Him, that thou mayst proclaim</p>
<p class="slindent">With how many teeth this love is biting thee.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The holy purpose of the Eagle of Christ</p>
<p class="slindent">Not latent was, nay, rather I perceived</p>
<p class="slindent">Whither he fain would my profession lead.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Therefore I recommenced: &ldquo;All of those bites</p>
<p class="slindent">Which have the power to turn the heart to God</p>
<p class="slindent">Unto my charity have been concurrent.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The being of the world, and my own being,</p>
<p class="slindent">The death which He endured that I may live,</p>
<p class="slindent">And that which all the faithful hope, as I do,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>With the forementioned vivid consciousness</p>
<p class="slindent">Have drawn me from the sea of love perverse,</p>
<p class="slindent">And of the right have placed me on the shore.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>As soon as I had ceased, a song most sweet</p>
<p class="slindent">Throughout the heaven resounded, and my Lady</p>
<p class="slindent">Said with the others, &ldquo;Holy, holy, holy!&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And as at some keen light one wakes from sleep</p>
<p class="slindent">By reason of the visual spirit that runs</p>
<p class="slindent">Unto the splendour passed from coat to coat,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Whence better after than before I saw,</p>

<p class="slindent">About a fourth light that I saw with us.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And said my Lady: &ldquo;There within those rays</p>
<p class="slindent">Gazes upon its Maker the first soul</p>
<p class="slindent">That ever the first virtue did create.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Even as the bough that downward bends its top</p>
<p class="slindent">At transit of the wind, and then is lifted</p>
<p class="slindent">By its own virtue, which inclines it upward,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Likewise did I, the while that she was speaking,</p>
<p class="slindent">Being amazed, and then I was made bold</p>
<p class="slindent">By a desire to speak wherewith I burned.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And I began: &ldquo;O apple, that mature</p>

<p class="slindent">That thou wouldst speak to me; thou seest my wish;</p>
<p class="slindent">And I, to hear thee quickly, speak it not.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Sometimes an animal, when covered, struggles</p>
<p class="slindent">So that his impulse needs must be apparent,</p>
<p class="slindent">By reason of the wrappage following it;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And in like manner the primeval soul</p>
<p class="slindent">Made clear to me athwart its covering</p>
<p class="slindent">How jubilant it was to give me pleasure.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then breathed: &ldquo;Without thy uttering it to me,</p>

<p class="slindent">Unto so long a stairway thee disposed.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Now, son of mine, the tasting of the tree</p>
<p class="slindent">Not in itself was cause of so great exile,</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>There, whence thy Lady moved Virgilius,</p>
<p class="slindent">Four thousand and three hundred and two circuits</p>
<p class="slindent">Made by the sun, this Council I desired;</p></div>

<p class="slindent">Of his highway nine hundred times and thirty,</p>
<p class="slindent">Whilst I upon the earth was tarrying.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And whatsoever star seems smallest here</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>But in the world of sense we can perceive</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>My Lady thus; then said she: &ldquo;Do thou take</p>
<p class="slindent">What I shall tell thee, if thou wouldst be sated,</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>On which account, if thou unto the virtue</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thou wilt behold a marvellous agreement,</p>

<p class="slindent">And not in that which loves, and follows next;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And of this seeing merit is the measure,</p>
<p class="slindent">Which is brought forth by grace, and by good will;</p>
<p class="slindent">Thus on from grade to grade doth it proceed.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>As long as from the time the zenith holds them</p>
<p class="slindent">In equipoise, till from that girdle both</p>
<p class="slindent">Changing their hemisphere disturb the balance,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So long, her face depicted with a smile,</p>
<p class="slindent">Did Beatrice keep silence while she gazed</p>
<p class="slindent">Fixedly at the point which had o&rsquo;ercome me.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then she began: &ldquo;I say, and I ask not</p>
<p class="slindent">What thou dost wish to hear, for I have seen it</p>
<p class="slindent">Where centres every When and every &lsquo;Ubi.&rsquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Not to acquire some good unto himself,</p>
<p class="slindent">Which is impossible, but that his splendour</p>
<p class="slindent">In its resplendency may say, &lsquo;Subsisto,&rsquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>In his eternity outside of time,</p>
<p class="slindent">Outside all other limits, as it pleased him,</p>
<p class="slindent">Into new Loves the Eternal Love unfolded.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Nor as if torpid did he lie before;</p>
<p class="slindent">For neither after nor before proceeded</p>
<p class="slindent">The going forth of God upon these waters.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Matter and Form unmingled and conjoined</p>
<p class="slindent">Came into being that had no defect,</p>
<p class="slindent">E&rsquo;en as three arrows from a three-stringed bow.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And as in glass, in amber, or in crystal</p>
<p class="slindent">A sunbeam flashes so, that from its coming</p>
<p class="slindent">To its full being is no interval,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So from its Lord did the triform effect</p>
<p class="slindent">Ray forth into its being all together,</p>
<p class="slindent">Without discrimination of beginning.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Order was con-created and constructed</p>
<p class="slindent">In substances, and summit of the world</p>
<p class="slindent">Were those wherein the pure act was produced.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Pure potentiality held the lowest part;</p>
<p class="slindent">Midway bound potentiality with act</p>
<p class="slindent">Such bond that it shall never be unbound.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Jerome has written unto you of angels</p>
<p class="slindent">Created a long lapse of centuries</p>
<p class="slindent">Or ever yet the other world was made;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But written is this truth in many places</p>
<p class="slindent">By writers of the Holy Ghost, and thou</p>
<p class="slindent">Shalt see it, if thou lookest well thereat.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And even reason seeth it somewhat,</p>
<p class="slindent">For it would not concede that for so long</p>
<p class="slindent">Could be the motors without their perfection.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Now dost thou know both where and when these Loves</p>
<p class="slindent">Created were, and how; so that extinct</p>
<p class="slindent">In thy desire already are three fires.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Nor could one reach, in counting, unto twenty</p>
<p class="slindent">So swiftly, as a portion of these angels</p>
<p class="slindent">Disturbed the subject of your elements.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The rest remained, and they began this art</p>
<p class="slindent">Which thou discernest, with so great delight</p>
<p class="slindent">That never from their circling do they cease.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The occasion of the fall was the accursed</p>
<p class="slindent">Presumption of that One, whom thou hast seen</p>
<p class="slindent">By all the burden of the world constrained.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Those whom thou here beholdest modest were</p>
<p class="slindent">To recognise themselves as of that goodness</p>
<p class="slindent">Which made them apt for so much understanding;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>On which account their vision was exalted</p>
<p class="slindent">By the enlightening grace and their own merit,</p>
<p class="slindent">So that they have a full and steadfast will.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I would not have thee doubt, but certain be,</p>
<p class="slindent">&rsquo;Tis meritorious to receive this grace,</p>
<p class="slindent">According as the affection opens to it.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Now round about in this consistory</p>
<p class="slindent">Much mayst thou contemplate, if these my words</p>
<p class="slindent">Be gathered up, without all further aid.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But since upon the earth, throughout your schools,</p>
<p class="slindent">They teach that such is the angelic nature</p>
<p class="slindent">That it doth hear, and recollect, and will,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>More will I say, that thou mayst see unmixed</p>
<p class="slindent">The truth that is confounded there below,</p>
<p class="slindent">Equivocating in such like prelections.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>These substances, since in God&rsquo;s countenance</p>
<p class="slindent">They jocund were, turned not away their sight</p>
<p class="slindent">From that wherefrom not anything is hidden;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Hence they have not their vision intercepted</p>
<p class="slindent">By object new, and hence they do not need</p>
<p class="slindent">To recollect, through interrupted thought.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So that below, not sleeping, people dream,</p>
<p class="slindent">Believing they speak truth, and not believing;</p>
<p class="slindent">And in the last is greater sin and shame.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Below you do not journey by one path</p>
<p class="slindent">Philosophising; so transporteth you</p>
<p class="slindent">Love of appearance and the thought thereof.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And even this above here is endured</p>
<p class="slindent">With less disdain, than when is set aside</p>
<p class="slindent">The Holy Writ, or when it is distorted.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>They think not there how much of blood it costs</p>
<p class="slindent">To sow it in the world, and how he pleases</p>
<p class="slindent">Who in humility keeps close to it.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Each striveth for appearance, and doth make</p>
<p class="slindent">His own inventions; and these treated are</p>
<p class="slindent">By preachers, and the Evangel holds its peace.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>One sayeth that the moon did backward turn,</p>
<p class="slindent">In the Passion of Christ, and interpose herself</p>
<p class="slindent">So that the sunlight reached not down below;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And lies; for of its own accord the light</p>
<p class="slindent">Hid itself; whence to Spaniards and to Indians,</p>
<p class="slindent">As to the Jews, did such eclipse respond.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Florence has not so many Lapi and Bindi</p>
<p class="slindent">As fables such as these, that every year</p>
<p class="slindent">Are shouted from the pulpit back and forth,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>In such wise that the lambs, who do not know,</p>
<p class="slindent">Come back from pasture fed upon the wind,</p>
<p class="slindent">And not to see the harm doth not excuse them.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Christ did not to his first disciples say,</p>
<p class="slindent">&lsquo;Go forth, and to the world preach idle tales,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">But unto them a true foundation gave;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And this so loudly sounded from their lips,</p>
<p class="slindent">That, in the warfare to enkindle Faith,</p>
<p class="slindent">They made of the Evangel shields and lances.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Now men go forth with jests and drolleries</p>
<p class="slindent">To preach, and if but well the people laugh,</p>
<p class="slindent">The hood puffs out, and nothing more is asked.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But in the cowl there nestles such a bird,</p>
<p class="slindent">That, if the common people were to see it,</p>
<p class="slindent">They would perceive what pardons they confide in,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>For which so great on earth has grown the folly,</p>
<p class="slindent">That, without proof of any testimony,</p>
<p class="slindent">To each indulgence they would flock together.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>By this Saint Anthony his pig doth fatten,</p>
<p class="slindent">And many others, who are worse than pigs,</p>
<p class="slindent">Paying in money without mark of coinage.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But since we have digressed abundantly,</p>
<p class="slindent">Turn back thine eyes forthwith to the right path,</p>
<p class="slindent">So that the way be shortened with the time.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>This nature doth so multiply itself</p>
<p class="slindent">In numbers, that there never yet was speech</p>
<p class="slindent">Nor mortal fancy that can go so far.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And if thou notest that which is revealed</p>
<p class="slindent">By Daniel, thou wilt see that in his thousands</p>
<p class="slindent">Number determinate is kept concealed.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The primal light, that all irradiates it,</p>
<p class="slindent">By modes as many is received therein,</p>
<p class="slindent">As are the splendours wherewith it is mated.</p></div>

<p class="slindent">The affection followeth, of love the sweetness</p>
<p class="slindent">Therein diversely fervid is or tepid.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The height behold now and the amplitude</p>

<p class="slindent">Whereat to turn mine eyes on Beatrice</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>If what has hitherto been said of her</p>

<p class="slindent">More than by problem of his theme was ever</p>
<p class="slindent">O&rsquo;ercome the comic or the tragic poet;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>For as the sun the sight that trembles most,</p>
<p class="slindent">Even so the memory of that sweet smile</p>
<p class="slindent">My mind depriveth of its very self.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>From the first day that I beheld her face</p>
<p class="slindent">In this life, to the moment of this look,</p>
<p class="slindent">The sequence of my song has ne&rsquo;er been severed;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But now perforce this sequence must desist</p>
<p class="slindent">From following her beauty with my verse,</p>

<p class="slindent">Than any of my trumpet, which is bringing</p>
<p class="slindent">Its arduous matter to a final close,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>With voice and gesture of a perfect leader</p>
<p class="slindent">She recommenced: &ldquo;We from the greatest body</p>

<p class="slindent">Which at the final judgment thou shalt see.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Even as a sudden lightning that disperses</p>
<p class="slindent">The visual spirits, so that it deprives</p>
<p class="slindent">The eye of impress from the strongest objects,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thus round about me flashed a living light,</p>
<p class="slindent">And left me swathed around with such a veil</p>
<p class="slindent">Of its effulgence, that I nothing saw.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Ever the Love which quieteth this heaven</p>
<p class="slindent">Welcomes into itself with such salute,</p>
<p class="slindent">To make the candle ready for its flame.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>No sooner had within me these brief words</p>
<p class="slindent">An entrance found, than I perceived myself</p>
<p class="slindent">To be uplifted over my own power,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And I with vision new rekindled me,</p>
<p class="slindent">Such that no light whatever is so pure</p>
<p class="slindent">But that mine eyes were fortified against it.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And light I saw in fashion of a river</p>
<p class="slindent">Fulvid with its effulgence, &rsquo;twixt two banks</p>
<p class="slindent">Depicted with an admirable Spring.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Out of this river issued living sparks,</p>
<p class="slindent">And on all sides sank down into the flowers,</p>
<p class="slindent">Like unto rubies that are set in gold;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And then, as if inebriate with the odours,</p>
<p class="slindent">They plunged again into the wondrous torrent,</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;The high desire, that now inflames and moves thee</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>But of this water it behoves thee drink</p>
<p class="slindent">Before so great a thirst in thee be slaked.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Thus said to me the sunshine of mine eyes;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And added: &ldquo;The river and the topazes</p>
<p class="slindent">Going in and out, and the laughing of the herbage,</p>
<p class="slindent">Are of their truth foreshadowing prefaces;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Not that these things are difficult in themselves,</p>

<p class="slindent">For yet thou hast not vision so exalted.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>There is no babe that leaps so suddenly</p>
<p class="slindent">With face towards the milk, if he awake</p>
<p class="slindent">Much later than his usual custom is,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>As I did, that I might make better mirrors</p>
<p class="slindent">Still of mine eyes, down stooping to the wave</p>
<p class="slindent">Which flows that we therein be better made.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And even as the penthouse of mine eyelids</p>
<p class="slindent">Drank of it, it forthwith appeared to me</p>
<p class="slindent">Out of its length to be transformed to round.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then as a folk who have been under masks</p>
<p class="slindent">Seem other than before, if they divest</p>
<p class="slindent">The semblance not their own they disappeared in,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thus into greater pomp were changed for me</p>
<p class="slindent">The flowerets and the sparks, so that I saw</p>
<p class="slindent">Both of the Courts of Heaven made manifest.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>O splendour of God! by means of which I saw</p>
<p class="slindent">The lofty triumph of the realm veracious,</p>
<p class="slindent">Give me the power to say how it I saw!</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>There is a light above, which visible</p>
<p class="slindent">Makes the Creator unto every creature,</p>
<p class="slindent">Who only in beholding Him has peace,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And it expands itself in circular form</p>
<p class="slindent">To such extent, that its circumference</p>
<p class="slindent">Would be too large a girdle for the sun.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The semblance of it is all made of rays</p>
<p class="slindent">Reflected from the top of Primal Motion,</p>
<p class="slindent">Which takes therefrom vitality and power.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And as a hill in water at its base</p>
<p class="slindent">Mirrors itself, as if to see its beauty</p>
<p class="slindent">When affluent most in verdure and in flowers,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So, ranged aloft all round about the light,</p>
<p class="slindent">Mirrored I saw in more ranks than a thousand</p>
<p class="slindent">All who above there have from us returned.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And if the lowest row collect within it</p>
<p class="slindent">So great a light, how vast the amplitude</p>
<p class="slindent">Is of this Rose in its extremest leaves!</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>My vision in the vastness and the height</p>
<p class="slindent">Lost not itself, but comprehended all</p>
<p class="slindent">The quantity and quality of that gladness.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>There near and far nor add nor take away;</p>
<p class="slindent">For there where God immediately doth govern,</p>
<p class="slindent">The natural law in naught is relevant.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Into the yellow of the Rose Eternal</p>
<p class="slindent">That spreads, and multiplies, and breathes an odour</p>
<p class="slindent">Of praise unto the ever-vernal Sun,</p></div>

<p class="slindent">On the same road he will not walk with him.</p></div>

<p class="slindent">As coming from thy power and from thy goodness</p>
<p class="slindent">I recognise the virtue and the grace.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thou from a slave hast brought me unto freedom,</p>
<p class="slindent">By all those ways, by all the expedients,</p>
<p class="slindent">Whereby thou hadst the power of doing it.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Preserve towards me thy magnificence,</p>
<p class="slindent">So that this soul of mine, which thou hast healed,</p>
<p class="slindent">Pleasing to thee be loosened from the body.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thus I implored; and she, so far away,</p>
<p class="slindent">Smiled, as it seemed, and looked once more at me;</p>
<p class="slindent">Then unto the eternal fountain turned.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And said the Old Man holy: &ldquo;That thou mayst</p>
<p class="slindent">Accomplish perfectly thy journeying,</p>
<p class="slindent">Whereunto prayer and holy love have sent me,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Fly with thine eyes all round about this garden;</p>
<p class="slindent">For seeing it will discipline thy sight</p>
<p class="slindent">Farther to mount along the ray divine.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And she, the Queen of Heaven, for whom I burn</p>
<p class="slindent">Wholly with love, will grant us every grace,</p>
<p class="slindent">Because that I her faithful Bernard am.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>As he who peradventure from Croatia</p>
<p class="slindent">Cometh to gaze at our Veronica,</p>
<p class="slindent">Who through its ancient fame is never sated,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But says in thought, the while it is displayed,</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;My Lord, Christ Jesus, God of very God,</p>
<p class="slindent">Now was your semblance made like unto this?&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Even such was I while gazing at the living</p>
<p class="slindent">Charity of the man, who in this world</p>
<p class="slindent">By contemplation tasted of that peace.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;Thou son of grace, this jocund life,&rdquo; began he,</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Will not be known to thee by keeping ever</p>
<p class="slindent">Thine eyes below here on the lowest place;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But mark the circles to the most remote,</p>
<p class="slindent">Until thou shalt behold enthroned the Queen</p>
<p class="slindent">To whom this realm is subject and devoted.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I lifted up mine eyes, and as at morn</p>
<p class="slindent">The oriental part of the horizon</p>
<p class="slindent">Surpasses that wherein the sun goes down,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thus, as if going with mine eyes from vale</p>
<p class="slindent">To mount, I saw a part in the remoteness</p>
<p class="slindent">Surpass in splendour all the other front.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And even as there where we await the pole</p>
<p class="slindent">That Phaeton drove badly, blazes more</p>
<p class="slindent">The light, and is on either side diminished,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So likewise that pacific oriflamme</p>
<p class="slindent">Gleamed brightest in the centre, and each side</p>
<p class="slindent">In equal measure did the flame abate.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And at that centre, with their wings expanded,</p>
<p class="slindent">More than a thousand jubilant Angels saw I,</p>
<p class="slindent">Each differing in effulgence and in kind.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I saw there at their sports and at their songs</p>
<p class="slindent">A beauty smiling, which the gladness was</p>
<p class="slindent">Within the eyes of all the other saints;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And if I had in speaking as much wealth</p>
<p class="slindent">As in imagining, I should not dare</p>
<p class="slindent">To attempt the smallest part of its delight.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Bernard, as soon as he beheld mine eyes</p>
<p class="slindent">Fixed and intent upon its fervid fervour,</p>
<p class="slindent">His own with such affection turned to her</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>That it made mine more ardent to behold.</p></div>`,

`<p class="cantohead">Paradiso: Canto XXXII</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>Absorbed in his delight, that contemplator</p>
<p class="slindent">Assumed the willing office of a teacher,</p>
<p class="slindent">And gave beginning to these holy words:</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;The wound that Mary closed up and anointed,</p>
<p class="slindent">She at her feet who is so beautiful,</p>
<p class="slindent">She is the one who opened it and pierced it.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Within that order which the third seats make</p>
<p class="slindent">Is seated Rachel, lower than the other,</p>
<p class="slindent">With Beatrice, in manner as thou seest.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Sarah, Rebecca, Judith, and her who was</p>
<p class="slindent">Ancestress of the Singer, who for dole</p>
<p class="slindent">Of the misdeed said, &lsquo;Miserere mei,&rsquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Canst thou behold from seat to seat descending</p>
<p class="slindent">Down in gradation, as with each one&rsquo;s name</p>
<p class="slindent">I through the Rose go down from leaf to leaf.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And downward from the seventh row, even as</p>
<p class="slindent">Above the same, succeed the Hebrew women,</p>
<p class="slindent">Dividing all the tresses of the flower;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Because, according to the view which Faith</p>
<p class="slindent">In Christ had taken, these are the partition</p>
<p class="slindent">By which the sacred stairways are divided.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Upon this side, where perfect is the flower</p>
<p class="slindent">With each one of its petals, seated are</p>
<p class="slindent">Those who believed in Christ who was to come.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Upon the other side, where intersected</p>
<p class="slindent">With vacant spaces are the semicircles,</p>
<p class="slindent">Are those who looked to Christ already come.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And as, upon this side, the glorious seat</p>
<p class="slindent">Of the Lady of Heaven, and the other seats</p>
<p class="slindent">Below it, such a great division make,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>So opposite doth that of the great John,</p>
<p class="slindent">Who, ever holy, desert and martyrdom</p>
<p class="slindent">Endured, and afterwards two years in Hell.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And under him thus to divide were chosen</p>
<p class="slindent">Francis, and Benedict, and Augustine,</p>
<p class="slindent">And down to us the rest from round to round.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Behold now the high providence divine;</p>
<p class="slindent">For one and other aspect of the Faith</p>
<p class="slindent">In equal measure shall this garden fill.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And know that downward from that rank which cleaves</p>
<p class="slindent">Midway the sequence of the two divisions,</p>
<p class="slindent">Not by their proper merit are they seated;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But by another&rsquo;s under fixed conditions;</p>
<p class="slindent">For these are spirits one and all assoiled</p>
<p class="slindent">Before they any true election had.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Well canst thou recognise it in their faces,</p>
<p class="slindent">And also in their voices puerile,</p>
<p class="slindent">If thou regard them well and hearken to them.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Now doubtest thou, and doubting thou art silent;</p>
<p class="slindent">But I will loosen for thee the strong bond</p>
<p class="slindent">In which thy subtile fancies hold thee fast.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Within the amplitude of this domain</p>
<p class="slindent">No casual point can possibly find place,</p>
<p class="slindent">No more than sadness can, or thirst, or hunger;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>For by eternal law has been established</p>
<p class="slindent">Whatever thou beholdest, so that closely</p>
<p class="slindent">The ring is fitted to the finger here.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And therefore are these people, festinate</p>
<p class="slindent">Unto true life, not &lsquo;sine causa&rsquo; here</p>
<p class="slindent">More and less excellent among themselves.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The King, by means of whom this realm reposes</p>
<p class="slindent">In so great love and in so great delight</p>
<p class="slindent">That no will ventureth to ask for more,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>In his own joyous aspect every mind</p>
<p class="slindent">Creating, at his pleasure dowers with grace</p>
<p class="slindent">Diversely; and let here the effect suffice.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And this is clearly and expressly noted</p>
<p class="slindent">For you in Holy Scripture, in those twins</p>
<p class="slindent">Who in their mother had their anger roused.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>According to the colour of the hair,</p>
<p class="slindent">Therefore, with such a grace the light supreme</p>
<p class="slindent">Consenteth that they worthily be crowned.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Without, then, any merit of their deeds,</p>
<p class="slindent">Stationed are they in different gradations,</p>
<p class="slindent">Differing only in their first acuteness.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&rsquo;Tis true that in the early centuries,</p>
<p class="slindent">With innocence, to work out their salvation</p>
<p class="slindent">Sufficient was the faith of parents only.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>After the earlier ages were completed,</p>
<p class="slindent">Behoved it that the males by circumcision</p>
<p class="slindent">Unto their innocent wings should virtue add;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But after that the time of grace had come</p>
<p class="slindent">Without the baptism absolute of Christ,</p>
<p class="slindent">Such innocence below there was retained.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Look now into the face that unto Christ</p>
<p class="slindent">Hath most resemblance; for its brightness only</p>
<p class="slindent">Is able to prepare thee to see Christ.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>On her did I behold so great a gladness</p>
<p class="slindent">Rain down, borne onward in the holy minds</p>
<p class="slindent">Created through that altitude to fly,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>That whatsoever I had seen before</p>
<p class="slindent">Did not suspend me in such admiration,</p>
<p class="slindent">Nor show me such similitude of God.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And the same Love that first descended there,</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Ave Maria, gratia plena,&rdquo; singing,</p>
<p class="slindent">In front of her his wings expanded wide.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Unto the canticle divine responded</p>
<p class="slindent">From every part the court beatified,</p>
<p class="slindent">So that each sight became serener for it.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;O holy father, who for me endurest</p>
<p class="slindent">To be below here, leaving the sweet place</p>
<p class="slindent">In which thou sittest by eternal lot,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Who is the Angel that with so much joy</p>
<p class="slindent">Into the eyes is looking of our Queen,</p>
<p class="slindent">Enamoured so that he seems made of fire?&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thus I again recourse had to the teaching</p>
<p class="slindent">Of that one who delighted him in Mary</p>
<p class="slindent">As doth the star of morning in the sun.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And he to me: &ldquo;Such gallantry and grace</p>
<p class="slindent">As there can be in Angel and in soul,</p>
<p class="slindent">All is in him; and thus we fain would have it;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Because he is the one who bore the palm</p>
<p class="slindent">Down unto Mary, when the Son of God</p>
<p class="slindent">To take our burden on himself decreed.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But now come onward with thine eyes, as I</p>
<p class="slindent">Speaking shall go, and note the great patricians</p>
<p class="slindent">Of this most just and merciful of empires.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Those two that sit above there most enrapture</p>
<p class="slindent">As being very near unto Augusta,</p>
<p class="slindent">Are as it were the two roots of this Rose.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>He who upon the left is near her placed</p>
<p class="slindent">The father is, by whose audacious taste</p>
<p class="slindent">The human species so much bitter tastes.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Upon the right thou seest that ancient father</p>
<p class="slindent">Of Holy Church, into whose keeping Christ</p>
<p class="slindent">The keys committed of this lovely flower.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And he who all the evil days beheld,</p>
<p class="slindent">Before his death, of her the beauteous bride</p>
<p class="slindent">Who with the spear and with the nails was won,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Beside him sits, and by the other rests</p>
<p class="slindent">That leader under whom on manna lived</p>
<p class="slindent">The people ingrate, fickle, and stiff-necked.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Opposite Peter seest thou Anna seated,</p>
<p class="slindent">So well content to look upon her daughter,</p>
<p class="slindent">Her eyes she moves not while she sings Hosanna.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And opposite the eldest household father</p>
<p class="slindent">Lucia sits, she who thy Lady moved</p>
<p class="slindent">When to rush downward thou didst bend thy brows.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But since the moments of thy vision fly,</p>
<p class="slindent">Here will we make full stop, as a good tailor</p>
<p class="slindent">Who makes the gown according to his cloth,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And unto the first Love will turn our eyes,</p>
<p class="slindent">That looking upon Him thou penetrate</p>
<p class="slindent">As far as possible through his effulgence.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Truly, lest peradventure thou recede,</p>
<p class="slindent">Moving thy wings believing to advance,</p>
<p class="slindent">By prayer behoves it that grace be obtained;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Grace from that one who has the power to aid thee;</p>
<p class="slindent">And thou shalt follow me with thy affection</p>
<p class="slindent">That from my words thy heart turn not aside.&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And he began this holy orison.</p></div>`,

`<p class="cantohead">Paradiso: Canto XXXIII</p>

<p class="slindent">Humble and high beyond all other creature,</p>
<p class="slindent">The limit fixed of the eternal counsel,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Thou art the one who such nobility</p>
<p class="slindent">To human nature gave, that its Creator</p>
<p class="slindent">Did not disdain to make himself its creature.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Within thy womb rekindled was the love,</p>
<p class="slindent">By heat of which in the eternal peace</p>
<p class="slindent">After such wise this flower has germinated.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Here unto us thou art a noonday torch</p>
<p class="slindent">Of charity, and below there among mortals</p>
<p class="slindent">Thou art the living fountain-head of hope.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Lady, thou art so great, and so prevailing,</p>
<p class="slindent">That he who wishes grace, nor runs to thee,</p>
<p class="slindent">His aspirations without wings would fly.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Not only thy benignity gives succour</p>
<p class="slindent">To him who asketh it, but oftentimes</p>
<p class="slindent">Forerunneth of its own accord the asking.</p></div>

<p class="slindent">In thee magnificence; in thee unites</p>
<p class="slindent">Whate&rsquo;er of goodness is in any creature.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Now doth this man, who from the lowest depth</p>
<p class="slindent">Of the universe as far as here has seen</p>
<p class="slindent">One after one the spiritual lives,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Supplicate thee through grace for so much power</p>
<p class="slindent">That with his eyes he may uplift himself</p>
<p class="slindent">Higher towards the uttermost salvation.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And I, who never burned for my own seeing</p>
<p class="slindent">More than I do for his, all of my prayers</p>
<p class="slindent">Proffer to thee, and pray they come not short,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>That thou wouldst scatter from him every cloud</p>
<p class="slindent">Of his mortality so with thy prayers,</p>
<p class="slindent">That the Chief Pleasure be to him displayed.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Still farther do I pray thee, Queen, who canst</p>
<p class="slindent">Whate&rsquo;er thou wilt, that sound thou mayst preserve</p>
<p class="slindent">After so great a vision his affections.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Let thy protection conquer human movements;</p>
<p class="slindent">See Beatrice and all the blessed ones</p>
<p class="slindent">My prayers to second clasp their hands to thee!&rdquo;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The eyes beloved and revered of God,</p>
<p class="slindent">Fastened upon the speaker, showed to us</p>
<p class="slindent">How grateful unto her are prayers devout;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Then unto the Eternal Light they turned,</p>
<p class="slindent">On which it is not credible could be</p>
<p class="slindent">By any creature bent an eye so clear.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And I, who to the end of all desires</p>
<p class="slindent">Was now approaching, even as I ought</p>
<p class="slindent">The ardour of desire within me ended.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Bernard was beckoning unto me, and smiling,</p>
<p class="slindent">That I should upward look; but I already</p>
<p class="slindent">Was of my own accord such as he wished;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Because my sight, becoming purified,</p>
<p class="slindent">Was entering more and more into the ray</p>
<p class="slindent">Of the High Light which of itself is true.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>From that time forward what I saw was greater</p>
<p class="slindent">Than our discourse, that to such vision yields,</p>
<p class="slindent">And yields the memory unto such excess.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Even as he is who seeth in a dream,</p>
<p class="slindent">And after dreaming the imprinted passion</p>
<p class="slindent">Remains, and to his mind the rest returns not,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Even such am I, for almost utterly</p>
<p class="slindent">Ceases my vision, and distilleth yet</p>
<p class="slindent">Within my heart the sweetness born of it;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Even thus the snow is in the sun unsealed,</p>
<p class="slindent">Even thus upon the wind in the light leaves</p>
<p class="slindent">Were the soothsayings of the Sibyl lost.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>O Light Supreme, that dost so far uplift thee</p>
<p class="slindent">From the conceits of mortals, to my mind</p>
<p class="slindent">Of what thou didst appear re-lend a little,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And make my tongue of so great puissance,</p>
<p class="slindent">That but a single sparkle of thy glory</p>
<p class="slindent">It may bequeath unto the future people;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>For by returning to my memory somewhat,</p>
<p class="slindent">And by a little sounding in these verses,</p>
<p class="slindent">More of thy victory shall be conceived!</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I think the keenness of the living ray</p>
<p class="slindent">Which I endured would have bewildered me,</p>
<p class="slindent">If but mine eyes had been averted from it;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And I remember that I was more bold</p>
<p class="slindent">On this account to bear, so that I joined</p>
<p class="slindent">My aspect with the Glory Infinite.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>O grace abundant, by which I presumed</p>
<p class="slindent">To fix my sight upon the Light Eternal,</p>
<p class="slindent">So that the seeing I consumed therein!</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>I saw that in its depth far down is lying</p>
<p class="slindent">Bound up with love together in one volume,</p>
<p class="slindent">What through the universe in leaves is scattered;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Substance, and accident, and their operations,</p>
<p class="slindent">All interfused together in such wise</p>
<p class="slindent">That what I speak of is one simple light.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The universal fashion of this knot</p>
<p class="slindent">Methinks I saw, since more abundantly</p>
<p class="slindent">In saying this I feel that I rejoice.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>One moment is more lethargy to me,</p>
<p class="slindent">Than five and twenty centuries to the emprise</p>
<p class="slindent">That startled Neptune with the shade of Argo!</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>My mind in this wise wholly in suspense,</p>
<p class="slindent">Steadfast, immovable, attentive gazed,</p>
<p class="slindent">And evermore with gazing grew enkindled.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>In presence of that light one such becomes,</p>
<p class="slindent">That to withdraw therefrom for other prospect</p>
<p class="slindent">It is impossible he e&rsquo;er consent;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Because the good, which object is of will,</p>
<p class="slindent">Is gathered all in this, and out of it</p>
<p class="slindent">That is defective which is perfect there.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Shorter henceforward will my language fall</p>
<p class="slindent">Of what I yet remember, than an infant&rsquo;s</p>
<p class="slindent">Who still his tongue doth moisten at the breast.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Not because more than one unmingled semblance</p>
<p class="slindent">Was in the living light on which I looked,</p>
<p class="slindent">For it is always what it was before;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But through the sight, that fortified itself</p>
<p class="slindent">In me by looking, one appearance only</p>
<p class="slindent">To me was ever changing as I changed.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Within the deep and luminous subsistence</p>
<p class="slindent">Of the High Light appeared to me three circles,</p>
<p class="slindent">Of threefold colour and of one dimension,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>And by the second seemed the first reflected</p>
<p class="slindent">As Iris is by Iris, and the third</p>
<p class="slindent">Seemed fire that equally from both is breathed.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>O how all speech is feeble and falls short</p>
<p class="slindent">Of my conceit, and this to what I saw</p>
<p class="slindent">Is such, &rsquo;tis not enough to call it little!</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>O Light Eterne, sole in thyself that dwellest,</p>
<p class="slindent">Sole knowest thyself, and, known unto thyself</p>
<p class="slindent">And knowing, lovest and smilest on thyself!</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>That circulation, which being thus conceived</p>
<p class="slindent">Appeared in thee as a reflected light,</p>
<p class="slindent">When somewhat contemplated by mine eyes,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Within itself, of its own very colour</p>
<p class="slindent">Seemed to me painted with our effigy,</p>
<p class="slindent">Wherefore my sight was all absorbed therein.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>As the geometrician, who endeavours</p>
<p class="slindent">To square the circle, and discovers not,</p>
<p class="slindent">By taking thought, the principle he wants,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Even such was I at that new apparition;</p>
<p class="slindent">I wished to see how the image to the circle</p>
<p class="slindent">Conformed itself, and how it there finds place;</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>But my own wings were not enough for this,</p>
<p class="slindent">Had it not been that then my mind there smote</p>
<p class="slindent">A flash of lightning, wherein came its wish.</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>Here vigour failed the lofty fantasy:</p>
<p class="slindent">But now was turning my desire and will,</p>
<p class="slindent">Even as a wheel that equally is moved,</p></div>

<div class="stanza"><p>The Love which moves the sun and the other stars.</p></div>`]
