		<p>Sparrow! my pet’s delicious joy,</p>

		<p>And men whose gentler spirits still prevail.</p>
		<p>Dead is the Sparrow of my girl, the joy,</p>
		<p>Sparrow, my sweeting’s most delicious toy,</p>
		<p>Whom loved she dearer than her very eyes;</p>
		<p>For he was honeyed-pet and anywise</p>
		<p>Knew her, as even she her mother knew;</p>
		<p>Ne’er from her bosom’s harbourage he flew</p>
		<p>But ’round her hopping here, there, everywhere,</p>
		<p>Piped he to none but her his lady fair.</p>
		<p>Now must he wander o’er the darkling way</p>
		<p>Thither, whence life-return the Fates denay.</p>
		<p>But ah! beshrew you, evil Shadows low’ring</p>
		<p>In Orcus ever loveliest things devouring:</p>
		<p>Who bore so pretty a Sparrow fro’ her ta’en.</p>
		<p>(Oh hapless birdie and Oh deed of bane!)</p>

	<p class="cantosubhead">On his Pinnace.</p>
	<div class="stanza">
		<p>Yonder Pinnace ye (my guests!) behold</p>
		<p>Saith she was erstwhile fleetest-fleet of crafts,</p>
		<p>Nor could by swiftness of aught plank that swims,</p>
		<p>Be she outstripped, whether paddle plied,</p>
		<p>Or fared she scudding under canvas-sail.</p>
		<p>Eke she defieth threat’ning Adrian shore,</p>
		<p>Dare not denay her, insular Cyclades,</p>
		<p>And noble Rhodos and ferocious Thrace,</p>
		<p>Propontis too and blustering Pontic bight.</p>
		<p>Where she (my Pinnace now) in times before,</p>
		<p>Was leafy woodling on Cytórean Chine</p>
		<p>For ever loquent lisping with her leaves.</p>
		<p>Pontic Amastris! Box-tree-clad Cytórus!</p>
		<p>Cognisant were ye, and you weet full well</p>
		<p>(So saith my Pinnace) how from earliest age</p>
		<p>Upon your highmost-spiring peak she stood,</p>
		<p>How in your waters first her sculls were dipt,</p>
		<p>And thence thro’ many and many an important strait</p>
		<p>She bore her owner whether left or right,</p>
		<p>Where breezes bade her fare, or Jupiter deigned</p>
		<p>At once propitious strike the sail full square;</p>
		<p>Nor to the sea-shore gods was aught of vow</p>
		<p>By her deemed needful, when from Ocean’s bourne</p>
		<p>Extreme she voyaged for this limpid lake.</p>
		<p>Yet were such things whilome: now she retired</p>
		<p>In quiet age devotes herself to thee</p>
		<p>(O twin-born Castor) twain with Castor’s twin.</p>

		<p>All crepitation and mobility.</p>
		<p>Explain! none whoredoms (no!) shall close my lips.</p>
		<p>Why? such outfuttered flank thou ne’er wouldst show</p>
		<p>Had not some fulsome work by thee been wrought.</p>

		<p>By us belovèd, as shall none be loved.</p>

		<p>Damsel, adieu! Catullus obdurate grown</p>
