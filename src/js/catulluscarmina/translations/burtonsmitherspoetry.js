		<p class="cantosubhead">The Adventures of Atys.</p>
		    <div class="stanza">
		      <p>O’er high deep seas in speedy ship his voyage Atys sped</p>
		      <p>Until he trod the Phrygian grove with hurried eager tread</p>
		      <p>And as the gloomy tree-shorn stead, the she-god’s home, he sought</p>
		      <p>There sorely stung with fiery ire and madman’s vaguing thought,</p>
		      <p>Share he with sharpened flint the freight wherewith his form was fraught.</p>
		      <p>Then as the she-he sensèd limbs were void of manly strain</p>
		      <p>And sighted freshly shed a-ground spot of ensanguined stain,</p>
		      <p>Snatched she the timbrel’s legier load with hands as snowdrops white,</p>
		      <p>Thy timbrel, Mother Cybebé, the firstings of thy rite,</p>
		      <p>And as her tender finger-tips on bull-back hollow rang</p>
		      <p>She rose a-grieving and her song to listening comrades sang.</p>
		      <p>“Up Gallæ, hie together, haste for Cybebe’s deep grove,</p>
		      <p>Hie to the Dindyménean dame, ye flocks that love to rove;</p>
		      <p>The which affecting stranger steads as bound in exile’s brunt</p>
		      <p>My sect pursuing led by me have nerved you to confront</p>
		      <p>The raging surge of salty sea and ocean’s tyrant hand</p>
		      <p>As your hate of Venus’ hest your manly forms unmann’d,</p>
		      <p>Gladden your souls, ye mistresses, with sense of error bann’d.</p>
		      <p>Drive from your spirits dull delay, together follow ye</p>
		      <p>To hold of Phrygian goddess, home of Phrygian Cybebe,</p>
		      <p>Where loud the cymbal’s voice resounds with timbrel-echoes blending,</p>
		      <p>And where the Phrygian piper drones grave bass from reed a-bending,</p>
		      <p>Where toss their ivy-circled heads with might the Mænades</p>
		      <p>Where ply mid shrilly lullilooes the holiest mysteries,</p>
		      <p>Where to fly here and there be wont the she-god’s vaguing train,</p>
		      <p>Thither behoves us lead the dance in quick-step hasty strain.”</p>
		      <p>Soon as had Atys (bastard-she) this lay to comrades sung</p>
		      <p>The Chorus sudden lulliloos with quivering, quavering tongue,</p>
		      <p>Again the nimble timbrel groans, the scooped-out cymbals clash,</p>
		      <p>And up green Ida flits the Choir, with footsteps hurrying rash.</p>
		      <p>Then Atys frantic, panting, raves, a-wandering, lost, insane,</p>
		      <p>And leads with timbrel hent and treads the shades where shadows rain,</p>
		      <p>Like heifer spurning load of yoke in yet unbroken pride;</p>
		      <p>And the swift Gallæ follow fain their first and fleetfoot guide.</p>
		      <p>But when the home of Cybebe they make with toil out-worn</p>
		      <p>O’er much, they lay them down to sleep and gifts of Ceres scorn;</p>
		      <p>Till heavy slumbers seal their eyelids langourous, drooping lowly,</p>
		      <p>And raving phrenzy flies each brain departing softly, slowly.</p>
		      <p>But when Dan Sol with radiant eyes that fire his face of gold</p>
		      <p>Surveyed white aether and solid soil and waters uncontrol’d,</p>
		      <p>And chased with steeds sonorous-hooved the shades of lingering night,</p>
		      <p>Then sleep from waking Atys fled fleeting with sudden flight,</p>
		      <p>By Nymph Pásithae welcomèd to palpitating breast.</p>
		      <p>Thus when his phrenzy raging rash was soothed to gentlest rest,</p>
		      <p>Atys revolved deeds lately done, as thought from breast unfolding,</p>
		      <p>And what he’d lost and what he was with lucid sprite beholding,</p>
		      <p>To shallows led by surging soul again the way ’gan take.</p>
		      <p>There casting glance of weeping eyes where vasty billows brake,</p>
		      <p>Sad-voiced in pitifullest lay his native land bespake.</p>
		      <p>“Country of me, Creatress mine, O born to thee and bred,</p>
		      <p>By hapless me abandoned as by thrall from lordling fled,</p>
		      <p>When me to Ida’s groves and glades these vaguing footsteps bore</p>
		      <p>To tarry ’mid the snows and where lurk beasts in antres frore</p>
		      <p>And seek the deeply hidden lairs where furious ferals meet!</p>
		      <p>Where, Country! whither placed must I now hold thy site and seat?</p>
		      <p>Lief would these balls of eyes direct to thee their line of sight,</p>
		      <p>Which for a while, a little while, would free me from despite.</p>
		      <p>Must I for ever roam these groves from house and home afar?</p>
		      <p>Of country, parents, kith and kin (life’s boon) myself debar?</p>
		      <p>Fly Forum, fly Palestra, fly the Stadium, the Gymnase?</p>
		      <p>Wretch, ah poor wretch, I’m doomed (my soul!) to mourn throughout my days,</p>
		      <p>For what of form or figure is, which I failed to enjoy?</p>
		      <p>I full-grown man, I blooming youth, I stripling, I a boy,</p>
		      <p>I of Gymnasium erst the bloom, I too of oil the pride:</p>
		      <p>Warm was my threshold, ever stood my gateways opening wide,</p>
		      <p>My house was ever garlanded and hung with flowery freight,</p>
		      <p>And couch to quit with rising sun, has ever been my fate:</p>
		      <p>Now must I Cybebe’s she-slave, priestess of gods, be hight?</p>
		      <p>I Mænad I, mere bit of self, I neutral barren wight?</p>
		      <p>I spend my life-tide couch’t beneath high-towering Phrygian peaks?</p>
		      <p>I dwell on Ida’s verdant slopes mottled with snowy streaks,</p>
		      <p>Where homes the forest-haunting doe, where roams the wildling boar?</p>
		      <p>Now, now I rue my deed foredone, now, now it irks me sore!”</p>
		      <p>Whenas from out those roseate lips these accents rapid flew,</p>
		      <p>Bore them to ears divine consigned a Nuncio true and new;</p>
		      <p>Then Cybebe her lions twain disjoining from their yoke</p>
		      <p>The left-hand enemy of the herds a-goading thus bespoke:&mdash;</p>
		      <p>“Up feral fell! up, hie with him, see rage his footsteps urge,</p>
		      <p>See that his fury smite him till he seek the forest verge,</p>
		      <p>He who with over-freedom fain would fly mine empery.</p>
		      <p>Go, slash thy flank with lashing tail and sense the strokes of thee,</p>
		      <p>Make the whole mountain to thy roar sound and resound again,</p>
		      <p>And fiercely toss thy brawny neck that bears the tawny mane!”</p>
		      <p>So quoth an-angered Cybebe, and yoke with hand untied:</p>
		      <p>The feral rose in fiery wrath and self-inciting hied,</p>
		      <p>A-charging, roaring through the brake with breaking paws he tore.</p>
		      <p>But when he reached the humid sands where surges cream the shore,</p>
		      <p>Spying soft Atys lingering near the marbled pave of sea</p>
		      <p>He springs: the terror-madded wretch back to the wood doth flee,</p>
		      <p>Where for the remnant of her days a bondmaid’s life led she.</p>
		      <p>Great Goddess, Goddess Cybebe, Dindymus dame divine,</p>
		      <p>Far from my house and home thy wrath and wrack, dread mistress mine:</p>
		      <p>Goad others on with Fury’s goad, others to Ire consign!</p>

		      <p>Whenas the youths elect, of Argive vigour the oak-heart,</p>
		      <p>Longing the Golden Fleece of the Colchis-region to harry,</p>
		      <p>Dared in a poop swift-paced to span salt seas and their shallows,</p>

		      <p>Foremost of all to imbue rude Amphitrité with ship-lore.</p>
		      <p>Soon as her beak had burst through wind-rackt spaces of ocean,</p>

		      <p>Surged from the deep abyss and hoar-capped billows the faces</p>
		      <p>Seaborn, Nereids eyeing the prodigy wonder-smitten.</p>
		      <p>There too mortal orbs through softened spendours regarded</p>
		      <p>Ocean-nymphs who exposed bodies denuded of raiment</p>
		      <p>Bare to the breast upthrust from hoar froth capping the sea-depths.</p>
		      <p>Then Thetis Péleus fired (men say) a-sudden with love-lowe,</p>

		      <p>Bred by your mothers, all hail! and placid deal me your favour.</p>
		      <p>Oft wi’ the sound of me, in strains and spells I’ll invoke you;</p>
		      <p>Thee too by wedding-torch so happily, highly augmented,</p>
		      <p>Peleus, Thessaly’s ward, whomunto Jupiter’s self deigned</p>
		      <p>Yield of the freest gree his loves though gotten of Godheads.</p>

		      <p>Nor less Oceanus, with water compassing th’ Earth-globe?</p>

		      <p>Scyros desert abides: they quit Phthiotican Tempe,</p>
		      <p>Homesteads of Crannon-town, eke bulwarkt walls of Larissa;</p>

		      <p>None will the fields now till; soft wax all necks of the oxen,</p>

		      <p>Over whose point unuse displays the squalor of rust-stain.</p>
		      <p>But in the homestead’s heart, where’er that opulent palace</p>

		      <p>Offered a victim so that no more to Crete be deported</p>
		      <p>Lives by Cecropia doomed to burials burying nowise;</p>
		      <p>Then with a swifty ship and soft breathed breezes a-stirring,</p>

		      <p>Turned she, before fierce flame in all her body conceived she</p>
		      <p>Down in its deepest depths and burning amiddle her marrow.</p>
		      <p>Ah, with unmitigate heart exciting wretchedmost furies,</p>

		      <p>Thou too of Golgos Queen and Lady of leafy Idalium,</p>

		      <p>How yet more, ever more, with golden splendour she palèd!</p>
		      <p>Whenas yearning to mate his might wi’ the furious monster</p>
		      <p>Theseus braved his death or sought the prizes of praises.</p>
		      <p>Then of her gifts to gods not ingrate, nor profiting naught,</p>
		      <p>Promise with silent lip, addressed she timidly vowing.</p>

		      <p>Nowhere is path for flight: none hope shows: all things are silent:</p>

		      <p>Yet never close these eyne in latest languor of dying,</p>
		      <p>Ne’er from my wearied frame go forth slow-ebbing my senses,</p>
		      <p>Ere from the Gods just doom implore I, treason-betrayed,</p>
		      <p>And with my breath supreme firm faith of Celestials invoke I.</p>
		      <p>Therefore, O ye who ’venge man’s deed with penalties direful,</p>

		      <p>Foreheads,&mdash;Oh, deign outspeak fierce wrath from bosom outbreathing,</p>

		      <p>And, as indeed all spring from veriest core of my bosom,</p>
		      <p>Suffer ye not the cause of grief and woe to evanish;</p>
		      <p>But wi’ the Will wherewith could Theseus leave me in loneness,</p>

		      <p class="slindent">E’en as she thus poured forth these words from anguish of bosom,</p>
		      <p>And for this cruel deed, distracted, sued she for vengeance,</p>
		      <p>Nodded the Ruler of Gods Celestial, matchless of All-might,</p>

		      <p>Meanwhile Theseus himself, obscured in blindness of darkness</p>
		      <p>As to his mind, dismiss’d from breast oblivious all things</p>
		      <p>Erewhile enjoined and held hereto in memory constant,</p>
		      <p>Nor for his saddened sire the gladness-signals uphoisting</p>
		      <p>Heralded safe return within sight of the Erechthean harbour.</p>
		      <p>For ’twas told of yore, when from walls of the Virginal Deëss</p>
		      <p>Ægeus speeding his son, to the care of breezes committed,</p>
		      <p>Thus with a last embrace to the youth spake words of commandment:</p>
		      <p class="slindent">“Son! far nearer my heart (sole thou) than life of the longest,</p>
		      <p>Son, I perforce dismiss to doubtful, dangerous chances,</p>

		      <p>Sithence such fortune in me, and in thee such boiling of valour</p>
		      <p>Tear thee away from me so loath, whose eyne in their languor</p>
		      <p>Never are sated with sight of my son, all-dearest of figures.</p>
		      <p>Nor will I send thee forth with joy that gladdens my bosom,</p>
		      <p>Nor will I suffer thee show boon signs of favouring Fortune,</p>
		      <p>But fro’ my soul I’ll first express an issue of sorrow,</p>
		      <p>Soiling my hoary hairs with dust and ashes commingled;</p>
		      <p>Then will I hang stained sails fast-made to the wavering yard-arms,</p>
		      <p>So shall our mourning thought and burning torture of spirit</p>
		      <p>Show by the dark sombre-dye of Iberian canvas spread.</p>
		      <p>But, an grant me the grace Who dwells in Sacred Itone,</p>

		      <p>Then do thou so-wise act, and storèd in memory’s heart-core</p>

		      <p>Dip, when first shall arise our hills to gladden thy eye-glance,</p>
		      <p>Down from thine every mast th’ill-omened vestments of mourning,</p>
		      <p>Then let the twisten ropes upheave the whitest of canvas,</p>

		      <p>These seeing sans delay with joy exalting my spirit</p>
		      <p>Well shall I wot boon Time sets thee returning before me.”</p>
		      <p class="slindent">Such were the mandates which stored at first in memory constant</p>
		      <p>Faded from Theseus’ mind like mists, compelled by the whirlwind,</p>
		      <p>Fleet from äerial crests of mountains hoary with snow-drifts.</p>

		      <p>Forthright e’en as he saw the sail-gear darkened with dye-stain,</p>

		      <p>Holding his Theseus lost by doom of pitiless Fortune.</p>
		      <p>Thus as he came to the home funest, his roof-tree paternal,</p>
