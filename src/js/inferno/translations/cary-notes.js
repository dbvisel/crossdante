		`<p class="cantohead">Canto I</p>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p><span class="sc">In</span> the midway{{1}} of this our mortal life,</p>
		<p>I found me in a gloomy wood, astray</p>
		<p>Gone from the path direct: and e&rsquo;en to tell</p>
		<p>It were no easy task, how savage wild</p>
		<p>That forest, how robust and rough its growth,</p>
		<p>Which to remember only, my dismay</p>
		<p>Renews, in bitterness not far from death.</p>
		<p>Yet to discourse of what there good befell,</p>
		<p>All else will I relate discover&rsquo;d there.</p>
		<p>How first I enter&rsquo;d it I scarce can say,</p>
		<p>Such sleepy dullness in that instant weigh&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>My senses down, when the true path I left,</p>
		<p>But when a mountain&rsquo;s foot I reach&rsquo;d, where clos&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>The valley, that had pierc&rsquo;d my heart with dread,</p>
		<p>I look&rsquo;d aloft, and saw his shoulders broad</p>
		<p>Already vested with that planet&rsquo;s beam{{2}},</p>
		<p>Who leads all wanderers safe through every way.</p>
		<p class="slindent">Then was a little respite to the fear,</p>
		<p>That in my heart&rsquo;s recesses deep had lain,</p>
		<p>All of that night, so pitifully pass&rsquo;d:</p>
		<p>And as a man, with difficult short breath,</p>
		<p>Forespent with toiling, &rsquo;scap&rsquo;d from sea to shore,</p>
		<p>Turns to the perilous wide waste, and stands</p>
		<p>At gaze; e&rsquo;en so my spirit, that yet fail&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Struggling with terror, turn&rsquo;d to view the straits,</p>
		<p>That none hath pass&rsquo;d and liv&rsquo;d. My weary frame</p>
		<p>After short pause recomforted, again</p>
		<p>I journey&rsquo;d on over that lonely steep,</p>
		<p>The hinder foot{{3}} still firmer. Scarce the ascent</p>
		<p>Began, when, lo! a panther{{4}}, nimble, light,</p>
		<p>And cover&rsquo;d with a speckled skin, appear&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Nor, when it saw me, vanish&rsquo;d, rather strove</p>
		<p>To check my onward going; that ofttimes</p>
		<p>With purpose to retrace my steps I turn&rsquo;d.</p>
		<p class="slindent">The hour was morning&rsquo;s prime, and on his way</p>
		<p>Aloft the sun ascended with those stars{{5}},</p>
		<p>That with him rose, when Love divine first mov&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Those its fair works: so that with joyous hope</p>
		<p>All things conspir&rsquo;d to fill me, the gay skin</p>
		<p>Of that swift animal, the matin dawn</p>
		<p>And the sweet season. Soon that joy was chas&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>And by new dread succeeded, when in view</p>
		<p>A lion{{6}} came, &rsquo;gainst me, as it appear&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>With his head held aloft and hunger-mad,</p>
		<p>That e&rsquo;en the air was fear-struck. A she-wolf{{7}}</p>
		<p>Was at his heels, who in her leanness seem&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Full of all wants, and many a land hath made</p>
		<p>Disconsolate ere now. She with such fear</p>
		<p>O&rsquo;erwhelmed me, at the sight of her appall&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>That of the height all hope I lost. As one,</p>
		<p>Who with his gain elated, sees the time</p>
		<p>When all unwares is gone, he inwardly</p>
		<p>Mourns with heart-griping anguish; such was I,</p>
		<p>Haunted by that fell beast, never at peace,</p>
		<p>Who coming o&rsquo;er against me, by degrees</p>
		<p>Impell&rsquo;d me where the sun in silence rests{{8}}.</p>
		<p class="slindent">While to the lower space with backward step</p>
		<p>I fell, my ken discern&rsquo;d the form one of one,</p>
		<p>Whose voice seem&rsquo;d faint through long disuse of speech.</p>
		<p>When him in that great desert I espied,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Have mercy on me!&rdquo; cried I out aloud,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Spirit! or living man! what e&rsquo;er thou be!&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">He answer&rsquo;d:&ldquo;ow not man, man once I was,</p>
		<p>And born of Lombard parents, Mantuana both</p>
		<p>By country, when the power of Julius{{9}} yet</p>
		<p>Was scarcely firm. At Rome my life was past</p>
		<p>Beneath the mild Augustus, in the time</p>
		<p>Of fabled deities and false. A bard</p>
		<p>Was I, and made Anchises&rsquo; upright son</p>
		<p>The subject of my song, who came from Troy,</p>
		<p>When the flames prey&rsquo;d on Ilium&rsquo;s haughty towers.</p>
		<p>But thou, say wherefore to such perils past</p>
		<p>Return&rsquo;st thou? wherefore not this pleasant mount</p>
		<p>Ascendest, cause and source of all delight?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;And art thou then that Virgil, that well-spring,</p>
		<p>From which such copious floods of eloquence</p>
		<p>Have issued?&rdquo; I with front abash&rsquo;d replied.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Glory and light of all the tuneful train!</p>
		<p>May it avail me that I long with zeal</p>
		<p>Have sought thy volume, and with love immense</p>
		<p>Have conn&rsquo;d it o&rsquo;er. My master thou and guide!</p>
		<p>Thou he from whom alone I have deriv&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>That style, which for its beauty into fame</p>
		<p>Exalts me. See the beast, from whom I fled.</p>
		<p>O save me from her, thou illustrious sage!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;For every vein and pulse throughout my frame</p>
		<p>She hath made tremble.&rdquo; He, soon as he saw</p>
		<p>That I was weeping, answer&rsquo;d, &ldquo;Thou must needs</p>
		<p>Another way pursue, if thou wouldst &rsquo;scape</p>
		<p>From out that savage wilderness. This beast,</p>
		<p>At whom thou criest, her way will suffer none</p>
		<p>To pass, and no less hindrance makes than death:</p>
		<p>So bad and so accursed in her kind,</p>
		<p>That never sated is her ravenous will,</p>
		<p>Still after food more craving than before.</p>
		<p>To many an animal in wedlock vile</p>
		<p>She fastens, and shall yet to many more,</p>
		<p>Until that greyhound{{10}} come, who shall destroy</p>
		<p>Her with sharp pain. He will not life support</p>
		<p>By earth nor its base metals, but by love,</p>
		<p>Wisdom, and virtue, and his land shall be</p>
		<p>The land &rsquo;twixt either Feltro{{11}}. In his might</p>
		<p>Shall safety to Italia&rsquo;s plains{{12}} arise,</p>
		<p>For whose fair realm, Camilla, virgin pure,</p>
		<p>Nisus, Euryalus, and Turnus fell.</p>
		<p>He with incessant chase through every town</p>
		<p>Shall worry, until he to hell at length</p>
		<p>Restore her, thence by envy first let loose.</p>
		<p>I for thy profit pond&rsquo;ring now devise,</p>
		<p>That thou mayst follow me, and I thy guide</p>
		<p>Will lead thee hence through an eternal space,</p>
		<p>Where thou shalt hear despairing shrieks, and see</p>
		<p>Spirits of old tormented, who invoke</p>
		<p>A second death; and those next view, who dwell</p>
		<p>Content in fire{{13}}, for that they hope to come,</p>
		<p>Whene&rsquo;er the time may be, among the blest,</p>
		<p>Into whose regions if thou then desire</p>
		<p>T&rsquo; ascend, a spirit worthier{{14}} then I</p>
		<p>Must lead thee, in whose charge, when I depart,</p>
		<p>Thou shalt be left: for that Almighty King,</p>
		<p>Who reigns above, a rebel to his law,</p>
		<p>Adjudges me, and therefore hath decreed,</p>
		<p>That to his city none through me should come.</p>
		<p>He in all parts hath sway; there rules, there holds</p>
		<p>His citadel and throne. O happy those,</p>
		<p>Whom there he chooses!&rdquo; I to him in few:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Bard! by that God, whom thou didst not adore,</p>
		<p>I do beseech thee (that this ill and worse</p>
		<p>I may escape) to lead me, where thou saidst,</p>
		<p>That I Saint Peter&rsquo;s gate{{15}} may view, and those</p>
		<p>Who as thou tell&rsquo;st, are in such dismal plight.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Onward he mov&rsquo;d, I close his steps pursu&rsquo;d.</p>
		</div>`,

		`<p class="cantohead">Canto II</p>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p><span class="sc">Now</span> was the day{{1}} departing, and the air,</p>
		<p>Imbrown&rsquo;d with shadows, from their toils releas&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>All animals on earth; and I alone</p>
		<p>Prepar&rsquo;d myself the conflict to sustain,</p>
		<p>Both of sad pity, and that perilous road,</p>
		<p>Which my unerring memory shall retrace.</p>
		<p class="slindent">O Muses! O high genius! now vouchsafe</p>
		<p>Your aid! O mind{{2}}! that all I saw hast kept</p>
		<p>Safe in a written record, here thy worth</p>
		<p>And eminent endowments come to proof.</p>
		<p class="slindent">I thus began: &ldquo;Bard! thou who art my guide,</p>
		<p>Consider well, if virtue be in me</p>
		<p>Sufficient, ere to this high enterprise</p>
		<p>Thou trust me. Thou hast told that Silvius&rsquo; sire{{3}},</p>
		<p>Yet cloth&rsquo;d in corruptible flesh, among</p>
		<p>Th&rsquo; immortal tribes had entrance, and was there</p>
		<p>Sensible present. Yet if heaven&rsquo;s great Lord,</p>
		<p>Almighty foe to ill, such favour shew&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>In contemplation of the high effect,</p>
		<p>Both what and who from him should issue forth,</p>
		<p>It seems in reason&rsquo;s judgment well deserv&rsquo;d:</p>
		<p>Sith he of Rome, and of Rome&rsquo;s empire wide,</p>
		<p>In heaven&rsquo;s empyreal height was chosen sire:</p>
		<p>Both which, if truth be spoken, were ordain&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>And &rsquo;stablish&rsquo;d for the holy place, where sits</p>
		<p>Who to great Peter&rsquo;s sacred chair succeeds.</p>
		<p>He from this journey, in thy song renown&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Learn&rsquo;d things, that to his victory gave rise</p>
		<p>And to the papal robe. In after-times</p>
		<p>The chosen vessel{{4}} also travel&rsquo;d there,</p>
		<p>To bring us back assurance in that faith,</p>
		<p>Which is the entrance to salvation&rsquo;s way.</p>
		<p>But I, why should I there presume? or who</p>
		<p>Permits it? not, Aeneas I nor Paul.</p>
		<p>Myself I deem not worthy, and none else</p>
		<p>Will deem me. I, if on this voyage then</p>
		<p>I venture, fear it will in folly end.</p>
		<p>Thou, who art wise, better my meaning know&rsquo;st,</p>
		<p>Than I can speak.&rdquo; As one, who unresolves</p>
		<p>What he hath late resolv&rsquo;d, and with new thoughts</p>
		<p>Changes his purpose, from his first intent</p>
		<p>Remov&rsquo;d; e&rsquo;en such was I on that dun coast,</p>
		<p>Wasting in thought my enterprise, at first</p>
		<p>So eagerly embrac&rsquo;d. &ldquo;If right thy words</p>
		<p>I scan,&rdquo; replied that shade magnanimous,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Thy soul{{5}} is by vile fear assail&rsquo;d, which oft</p>
		<p>So overcasts a man, that he recoils</p>
		<p>From noblest resolution, like a beast</p>
		<p>At some false semblance in the twilight gloom.</p>
		<p>That from this terror thou mayst free thyself,</p>
		<p>I will instruct thee why I came, and what</p>
		<p>I heard in that same instant, when for thee</p>
		<p>Grief touch&rsquo;d me first. I was among the tribe,</p>
		<p>Who rest suspended{{6}}, when a dame, so blest</p>
		<p>And lovely, I besought her to command,</p>
		<p>Call&rsquo;d me; her eyes were brighter than the star</p>
		<p>Of day; and she with gentle voice and soft</p>
		<p>Angelically tun&rsquo;d her speech address&rsquo;d:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;O courteous shade of Mantua! thou whose fame</p>
		<p>Yet lives, and shall live long as nature lasts!</p>
		<p>A friend, not of my fortune but myself{{7}},</p>
		<p>On the wide desert in his road has met</p>
		<p>Hindrance so great, that he through fear has turn&rsquo;d.</p>
		<p>Now much I dread lest he past help have stray&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>And I be ris&rsquo;n too late for his relief,</p>
		<p>From what in heaven of him I heard. Speed now,</p>
		<p>And by thy eloquent persuasive tongue,</p>
		<p>And by all means for his deliverance meet,</p>
		<p>Assist him. So to me will comfort spring.</p>
		<p>I who now bid thee on this errand forth</p>
		<p>Am Beatrice{{8}}; from a place I come</p>
		<p>Revisited with joy. Love brought me thence,</p>
		<p>Who prompts my speech. When in my Master&rsquo;s sight</p>
		<p>I stand, thy praise to him I oft will tell.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">She then was silent, and I thus began:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;O Lady! by whose influence alone,</p>
		<p>Mankind excels whatever is contain&rsquo;d{{9}}</p>
		<p>Within that heaven which hath the smallest orb,</p>
		<p>So thy command delights me, that to obey,</p>
		<p>If it were done already, would seem late.</p>
		<p>No need hast thou farther to speak thy will;</p>
		<p>Yet tell the reason, why thou art not loth</p>
		<p>To leave that ample space, where to return</p>
		<p>Thou burnest, for this centre here beneath.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">She then: &ldquo;Since thou so deeply wouldst inquire,</p>
		<p>I will instruct thee briefly, why no dread</p>
		<p>Hinders my entrance here. Those things alone</p>
		<p>Are to be fear&rsquo;d, whence evil may proceed,</p>
		<p>None else, for none are terrible beside.</p>
		<p>I am so fram&rsquo;d by God, thanks to his grace!</p>
		<p>That any suff&rsquo;rance of your misery</p>
		<p>Touches me not, nor flame of that fierce fire</p>
		<p>Assails me. In high heaven a blessed dame{{10}}</p>
		<p>Besides, who mourns with such effectual grief</p>
		<p>That hindrance, which I send thee to remove,</p>
		<p>That God&rsquo;s stern judgment to her will inclines.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>To Lucia{{11}} calling, her she thus bespake:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Now doth thy faithful servant need thy aid</p>
		<p>And I commend him to thee.&rdquo; At her word</p>
		<p>Sped Lucia, of all cruelty the foe,</p>
		<p>And coming to the place, where I abode</p>
		<p>Seated with Rachel, her of ancient days,</p>
		<p>She thus address&rsquo;d me: &ldquo;Thou true praise of God!</p>
		<p>Beatrice! why is not thy succour lent</p>
		<p>To him, who so much lov&rsquo;d thee, as to leave</p>
		<p>For thy sake all the multitude admires?</p>
		<p>Dost thou not hear how pitiful his wail,</p>
		<p>Nor mark the death, which in the torrent flood,</p>
		<p>Swoln mightier than a sea, him struggling holds?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Ne&rsquo;er among men did any with such speed</p>
		<p>Haste to their profit, flee from their annoy,</p>
		<p>As when these words were spoken, I came here,</p>
		<p>Down from my blessed seat, trusting the force</p>
		<p>Of thy pure eloquence, which thee, and all</p>
		<p>Who well have mark&rsquo;d it, into honour brings.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;When she had ended, her bright beaming eyes</p>
		<p>Tearful she turn&rsquo;d aside; whereat I felt</p>
		<p>Redoubled zeal to serve thee. As she will&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Thus am I come: I sav&rsquo;d thee from the beast,</p>
		<p>Who thy near way across the goodly mount</p>
		<p>Prevented. What is this comes o&rsquo;er thee then?</p>
		<p>Why, why dost thou hang back? why in thy breast</p>
		<p>Harbour vile fear? why hast not courage there</p>
		<p>And noble daring? Since three maids{{12}} so blest</p>
		<p>Thy safety plan, e&rsquo;en in the court of heaven;</p>
		<p>And so much certain good my words forebode.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">As florets{{13}}, by the frosty air of night</p>
		<p>Bent down and clos&rsquo;d, when day has blanch&rsquo;d their leaves,</p>
		<p>Rise all unfolded on their spiry stems;</p>
		<p>So was my fainting vigour new restor&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>And to my heart such kindly courage ran,</p>
		<p>That I as one undaunted soon replied:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;O full of pity she, who undertook</p>
		<p>My succour! and thou kind who didst perform</p>
		<p>So soon her true behest! With such desire</p>
		<p>Thou hast dispos&rsquo;d me to renew my voyage,</p>
		<p>That my first purpose fully is resum&rsquo;d.</p>
		<p>Lead on: one only will is in us both.</p>
		<p>Thou art my guide, my master thou, and lord.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">So spake I; and when he had onward mov&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>I enter&rsquo;d on the deep and woody way.</p>
		</div>`,

		`<p class="cantohead">Canto III</p>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Through</span> me you pass into the city of woe:</p>
		<p>Through me you pass into eternal pain:</p>
		<p>Through me among the people lost for aye.</p>
		<p>Justice the founder of my fabric mov&rsquo;d:</p>
		<p>To rear me was the task of power divine,</p>
		<p>Supremest wisdom, and primeval love{{1}}.</p>
		<p>Before me things create were none, save things</p>
		<p>Eternal, and eternal I endure.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;All hope abandon ye{{2}} who enter here.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Such characters in colour dim I mark&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Over a portal&rsquo;s lofty arch inscrib&rsquo;d:</p>
		<p>Whereat I thus: &ldquo;Master, these words import</p>
		<p>Hard meaning.&rdquo; He as one prepar&rsquo;d replied:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Here thou must all distrust behind thee leave;</p>
		<p>Here be vile fear extinguish&rsquo;d. We are come</p>
		<p>Where I have told thee we shall see the souls</p>
		<p>To misery doom&rsquo;d, who intellectual good</p>
		<p>Have lost.&rdquo; And when his hand he had stretch&rsquo;d forth</p>
		<p>To mine, with pleasant looks, whence I was cheer&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Into that secret place he led me on.</p>
		<p class="slindent">Here sighs with lamentations and loud moans</p>
		<p>Resounded through the air pierc&rsquo;d by no star,</p>
		<p>That e&rsquo;en I wept at entering. Various tongues,</p>
		<p>Horrible languages, outcries of woe,</p>
		<p>Accents of anger, voices deep and hoarse,</p>
		<p>With hands together smote that swell&rsquo;d the sounds,</p>
		<p>Made up a tumult, that for ever whirls</p>
		<p>Round through that air with solid darkness stain&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Like to the sand{{3}} that in the whirlwind flies.</p>
		<p class="slindent">I then, with error yet encompass&rsquo;d, cried:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;O master! What is this I hear? What race</p>
		<p>Are these, who seem so overcome with woe?&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">He thus to me: &ldquo;This miserable fate</p>
		<p>Suffer the wretched souls of those, who liv&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Without or praise or blame, with that ill band</p>
		<p>Of angels mix&rsquo;d, who nor rebellious prov&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Nor yet were true to God, but for themselves</p>
		<p>Were only. From his bounds Heaven drove them forth,</p>
		<p>Not to impair his lustre, nor the depth</p>
		<p>Of Hell receives them, lest th&rsquo; accursed tribe{{4}}</p>
		<p>Should glory thence with exultation vain.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">I then: &ldquo;Master! what doth aggrieve them thus,</p>
		<p>That they lament so loud?&rdquo; He straight replied:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;That will I tell thee briefly. These of death</p>
		<p>No hope may entertain: and their blind life</p>
		<p>So meanly passes, that all other lots</p>
		<p>They envy. Fame of them the world hath none,</p>
		<p>Nor suffers; mercy and justice scorn them both.</p>
		<p>Speak not of them, but look, and pass them by.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">And I, who straightway look&rsquo;d, beheld a flag{{5}},</p>
		<p>Which whirling ran around so rapidly,</p>
		<p>That it no pause obtain&rsquo;d: and following came</p>
		<p>Such a long train of spirits, I should ne&rsquo;er</p>
		<p>Have thought, that death so many had despoil&rsquo;d.</p>
		<p class="slindent">When some of these I recogniz&rsquo;d, I saw</p>
		<p>And knew the shade of him, who to base fear</p>
		<p>Yielding, abjur&rsquo;d his high estate{{6}}. Forthwith</p>
		<p>I understood for certain this the tribe</p>
		<p>Of those ill spirits both to God displeasing</p>
		<p>And to his foes. These wretches, who ne&rsquo;er lived,</p>
		<p>Went on in nakedness, and sorely stung</p>
		<p>By wasps and hornets, which bedew&rsquo;d their cheeks</p>
		<p>With blood, that mix&rsquo;d with tears dropp&rsquo;d to their feet,</p>
		<p>And by disgustful worms was gather&rsquo;d there.</p>
		<p class="slindent">Then looking farther onwards I beheld</p>
		<p>A throng upon the shore of a great stream:</p>
		<p>Whereat I thus: &ldquo;Sir! grant me now to know</p>
		<p>Whom here we view, and whence impell&rsquo;d they seem</p>
		<p>So eager to pass o&rsquo;er, as I discern</p>
		<p>Through the blear light?{{7}}&rdquo; He thus to me in few:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;This shalt thou know, soon as our steps arrive</p>
		<p>Beside the woeful tide of Acheron.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Then with eyes downward cast and fill&rsquo;d with shame,</p>
		<p>Fearing my words offensive to his ear,</p>
		<p>Till we had reach&rsquo;d the river, I from speech</p>
		<p>Abstain&rsquo;d. And lo! toward us in a bark</p>
		<p>Comes on an old man{{8}} hoary white with eld,</p>
		<p>Crying, &ldquo;Woe to you wicked spirits! hope not</p>
		<p>Ever to see the sky again. I come</p>
		<p>To take you to the other shore across,</p>
		<p>Into eternal darkness, there to dwell</p>
		<p>In fierce heat and in ice{{9}}. And thou, who there</p>
		<p>Standest, live spirit! get thee hence, and leave</p>
		<p>These who are dead.&rdquo; But soon as he beheld</p>
		<p>I left them not, &ldquo;By other way,&rdquo; said he,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;By other haven shalt thou come to shore,</p>
		<p>Not by this passage; thee a nimbler boat</p>
		<p>Must carry.&rdquo; Then to him thus spake my guide:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Charon! thyself torment not: so &rsquo;t is will&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Where will and power are one: ask thou no more.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Straightway in silence fell the shaggy cheeks</p>
		<p>Of him the boatman o&rsquo;er the livid lake{{10}},</p>
		<p>Around whose eyes glar&rsquo;d wheeling flames. Meanwhile</p>
		<p>Those spirits, faint and naked, color chang&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>And gnash&rsquo;d their teeth, soon as the cruel words</p>
		<p>They heard. God and their parents they blasphem&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>The human kind, the place, the time, and seed</p>
		<p>That did engender them and give them birth.</p>
		<p class="slindent">Then all together sorely wailing drew</p>
		<p>To the curs&rsquo;d strand, that every man must pass</p>
		<p>Who fears not God. Charon, demoniac form,</p>
		<p>With eyes of burning coal{{11}}, collects them all,</p>
		<p>Beck&rsquo;ning, and each, that lingers, with his oar</p>
		<p>Strikes. As fall off the light autumnal leaves{{12}},</p>
		<p>One still another following, till the bough</p>
		<p>Strews all its honours on the earth beneath;</p>
		<p>E&rsquo;en in like manner Adam&rsquo;s evil brood</p>
		<p>Cast themselves one by one down from the shore,</p>
		<p>Each at a beck, as falcon at his call.</p>
		<p class="slindent">Thus go they over through the umber&rsquo;d wave,</p>
		<p>And ever they on the opposing bank</p>
		<p>Be landed, on this side another throng</p>
		<p>Still gathers. &ldquo;Son,&rdquo; thus spake the courteous guide,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Those, who die subject to the wrath of God,</p>
		<p>All here together come from every clime,</p>
		<p>And to o&rsquo;erpass the river are not loth:</p>
		<p>For so heaven&rsquo;s justice goads them on, that fear</p>
		<p>Is turn&rsquo;d into desire. Hence ne&rsquo;er hath past</p>
		<p>Good spirit. If of thee Charon complain,</p>
		<p>Now mayst thou know the import of his words.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">This said, the gloomy region trembling shook</p>
		<p>So terribly, that yet with clammy dews</p>
		<p>Fear chills my brow. The sad earth gave a blast,</p>
		<p>That, lightening, shot forth a vermilion flame,</p>
		<p>Which all my senses conquer&rsquo;d quite, and I</p>
		<p>Down dropp&rsquo;d, as one with sudden slumber seiz&rsquo;d.</p>

		`<p class="cantohead">Canto IV</p>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p><span class="sc">Broke</span> the deep slumber in my brain a crash</p>
		<p>Of heavy thunder, that I shook myself,</p>
		<p>As one by main force rous&rsquo;d. Risen upright,</p>
		<p>My rested eyes I mov&rsquo;d around, and search&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>With fixed ken to know what place it was,</p>
		<p>Wherein I stood. For certain on the brink</p>
		<p>I found me of the lamentable vale,</p>
		<p>The dread abyss, that joins a thund&rsquo;rous sound{{1}}</p>
		<p>Of plaints innumerable. Dark and deep,</p>
		<p>And thick with clouds o&rsquo;erspread, mine eye in vain</p>
		<p>Explor&rsquo;d its bottom, nor could aught discern.</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Now let us to the blind world there beneath</p>
		<p>Descend;&rdquo; the bard began all pale of look:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I go the first, and thou shalt follow next.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Then I his alter&rsquo;d hue perceiving, thus:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;How may I speed, if thou yieldest to dread,</p>
		<p>Who still art wont to comfort me in doubt?&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">He then: &ldquo;The anguish of that race below</p>
		<p>With pity stains my cheek, which thou for fear</p>
		<p>Mistakest. Let us on. Our length of way</p>
		<p>Urges to haste.&rdquo; Onward, this said, he mov&rsquo;d;</p>
		<p>And ent&rsquo;ring led me with him on the bounds</p>
		<p>Of the first circle, that surrounds th&rsquo; abyss.</p>
		<p>Here, as mine ear could note, no plaint was heard</p>
		<p>Except of sighs, that made th&rsquo; eternal air</p>
		<p>Tremble, not caus&rsquo;d by tortures, but from grief</p>
		<p>Felt by those multitudes, many and vast,</p>
		<p>Of men, women, and infants. Then to me</p>
		<p>The gentle guide: &ldquo;Inquir&rsquo;st thou not what spirits</p>
		<p>Are these, which thou beholdest? Ere thou pass</p>
		<p>Farther, I would thou know, that these of sin</p>
		<p>Were blameless; and if aught they merited,</p>
		<p>It profits not, since baptism was not theirs,</p>
		<p>The portal to thy faith. If they before</p>
		<p>The Gospel liv&rsquo;d, they serv&rsquo;d not God aright;</p>
		<p>And among such am I. For these defects,</p>
		<p>And for no other evil, we are lost;&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Only so far afflicted, that we live</p>
		<p>Desiring without hope.&rdquo; So grief assail&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>My heart at hearing this, for well I knew</p>
		<p>Suspended in that Limbo many a soul</p>
		<p>Of mighty worth. &ldquo;O tell me, sire rever&rsquo;d!</p>
		<p>Tell me, my master!&rdquo; I began through wish</p>
		<p>Of full assurance in that holy faith,</p>
		<p>Which vanquishes all error; &ldquo;say, did e&rsquo;er</p>
		<p>Any, or through his own or other&rsquo;s merit,</p>
		<p>Come forth from thence, whom afterward was blest?&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Piercing the secret purport of my speech,</p>
		<p>He answer&rsquo;d: &ldquo;I was new to that estate,</p>
		<p>When I beheld a puissant one{{2}} arrive</p>
		<p>Amongst us, with victorious trophy crown&rsquo;d.</p>
		<p>He forth the shade of our first parent drew,</p>
		<p>Abel his child, and Noah righteous man,</p>
		<p>Of Moses lawgiver for faith approv&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Of patriarch Abraham, and David king,</p>
		<p>Israel with his sire and with his sons,</p>
		<p>Nor without Rachel whom so hard he won,</p>
		<p>And others many more, whom he to bliss</p>
		<p>Exalted. Before these, be thou assur&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>No spirit of human kind was ever sav&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">We, while he spake, ceas&rsquo;d not our onward road,</p>
		<p>Still passing through the wood; for so I name</p>
		<p>Those spirits thick beset. We were not far</p>
		<p>On this side from the summit, when I kenn&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>A flame, that o&rsquo;er the darken&rsquo;d hemisphere</p>
		<p>Prevailing shin&rsquo;d. Yet we a little space</p>
		<p>Were distant, not so far but I in part</p>
		<p>Discover&rsquo;d, that a tribe in honour high</p>
		<p>That place possess&rsquo;d. &ldquo;O thou, who every art</p>
		<p>And science valu&rsquo;st! who are these, that boast</p>
		<p>Such honour, separate from all the rest?&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">He answer&rsquo;d: &ldquo;The renown of their great names</p>
		<p>That echoes through your world above, acquires</p>
		<p>Favour in heaven, which holds them thus advanc&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Meantime a voice I heard: &ldquo;Honour the bard</p>
		<p>Sublime{{3}}! his shade returns that left us late!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>No sooner ceas&rsquo;d the sound, than I beheld</p>
		<p>Four mighty spirits toward us bend their steps,</p>
		<p>Of semblance neither sorrowful nor glad{{4}}.</p>
		<p class="slindent">When thus my master kind began: &ldquo;Mark him,</p>
		<p>Who in his right hand bears that falchion keen,</p>
		<p>The other three preceding, as their lord.</p>
		<p>This is that Homer, of all bards supreme:</p>
		<p>Flaccus the next in satire&rsquo;s vein excelling;</p>
		<p>The third is Naso; Lucan is the last.</p>
		<p>Because they all that appellation own,</p>
		<p>With which the voice singly accosted me,</p>
		<p>Honouring they greet me thus, and well they judge.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">So I beheld united the bright school</p>
		<p>Of him the monarch of sublimest song{{5}},</p>
		<p>That o&rsquo;er the others like an eagle soars.</p>
		<p>When they together short discourse had held,</p>
		<p>They turn&rsquo;d to me, with salutation kind</p>
		<p>Beck&rsquo;ning me; at the which my master smil&rsquo;d:</p>
		<p>Nor was this all; but greater honour still</p>
		<p>They gave me, for they made me of their tribe;</p>
		<p>And I was sixth amid so learn&rsquo;d a band.</p>
		<p class="slindent">Far as the luminous beacon on we pass&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Speaking of matters, then befitting well</p>
		<p>To speak, now fitter left untold{{6}}. At foot</p>
		<p>Of a magnificent castle we arriv&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Seven times with lofty walls begirt, and round</p>
		<p>Defended by a pleasant stream. O&rsquo;er this</p>
		<p>As o&rsquo;er dry land we pass&rsquo;d. Next through seven gates</p>
		<p>I with those sages enter&rsquo;d, and we came</p>
		<p>Into a mead with lively verdure fresh.</p>
		<p class="slindent">There dwelt a race, who slow their eyes around</p>
		<p>Majestically mov&rsquo;d, and in their port</p>
		<p>Bore eminent authority; they spake</p>
		<p>Seldom, but all their words were tuneful sweet.</p>
		<p class="slindent">We to one side retir&rsquo;d, into a place</p>
		<p>Open and bright and lofty, whence each one</p>
		<p>Stood manifest to view. Incontinent</p>
		<p>There on the green enamel of the plain</p>
		<p>Were shown me the great spirits, by whose sight</p>
		<p>I am exalted in my own esteem.</p>
		<p class="slindent">Electra{{7}} there I saw accompanied</p>
		<p>By many, among whom Hector I knew,</p>
		<p>Anchises&rsquo; pious son, and with hawk&rsquo;s eye</p>
		<p>Caesar all arm&rsquo;d, and by Camilla there</p>
		<p>Penthesilea. On the other side</p>
		<p>Old King Latinus, seated by his child</p>
		<p>Lavinia, and that Brutus I beheld,</p>
		<p>Who Tarquin chas&rsquo;d, Lucretia, Cato&rsquo;s wife</p>
		<p>Marcia, with Julia{{8}} and Cornelia there;</p>
		<p>And sole apart retir&rsquo;d, the Soldan fierce{{9}}.</p>
		<p class="slindent">Then when a little more I rais&rsquo;d my brow,</p>
		<p>I spied the master of the sapient throng{{10}},</p>
		<p>Seated amid the philosophic train.</p>
		<p>Him all admire, all pay him rev&rsquo;rence due.</p>
		<p>There Socrates and Plato both I mark&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Nearest to him in rank; Democritus,</p>
		<p>Who sets the world at chance{{11}}, Diogenes,</p>
		<p>With Heraclitus, and Empedocles,</p>
		<p>And Anaxagoras, and Thales sage,</p>
		<p>Zeno, and Dioscorides well read</p>
		<p>In nature&rsquo;s secret lore. Orpheus I mark&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>And Linus, Tully and moral Seneca,</p>
		<p>Euclid and Ptolemy, Hippocrates,</p>
		<p>Galenus, Avicen{{12}}, and him who made</p>
		<p>That commentary vast, Averroes{{13}}.</p>
		<p class="slindent">Of all to speak at full were vain attempt;</p>
		<p>For my wide theme so urges, that ofttimes</p>
		<p>My words fall short of what bechanc&rsquo;d. In two</p>
		<p>The six associates part. Another way</p>
		<p>My sage guide leads me, from that air serene,</p>
		<p>Into a climate ever vex&rsquo;d with storms:</p>
		<p>And to a part I come where no light shines.</p>

		`<p class="cantohead">Canto V</p>

		<p><span class="sc">From</span> the first circle I descended thus</p>
		<p>Down to the second, which, a lesser space</p>
		<p>Embracing, so much more of grief contains</p>
		<p>Provoking bitter moans. There, Minos stands</p>
		<p>Grinning with ghastly feature{{1}}: he, of all</p>
		<p>Who enter, strict examining the crimes,</p>
		<p>Gives sentence, and dismisses them beneath,</p>
		<p>According as he foldeth him around:</p>
		<p>For when before him comes th&rsquo; ill fated soul,</p>
		<p>It all confesses; and that judge severe</p>
		<p>Of sins, considering what place in hell</p>
		<p>Suits the transgression, with his tail so oft</p>
		<p>Himself encircles, as degrees beneath</p>
		<p>He dooms it to descend. Before him stand</p>
		<p>Always a num&rsquo;rous throng; and in his turn</p>
		<p>Each one to judgment passing, speaks, and hears</p>
		<p>His fate, thence downward to his dwelling hurl&rsquo;d.</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;O thou! who to this residence of woe</p>
		<p>Approachest?&rdquo; when he saw me coming, cried</p>
		<p>Minos, relinquishing his dread employ,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Look how thou enter here; beware in whom</p>
		<p>Thou place thy trust; let not the entrance broad</p>
		<p>Deceive thee to thy harm.&rdquo; To him my guide:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Wherefore exclaimest? Hinder not his way</p>
		<p>By destiny appointed; so &rsquo;tis will&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Where will and power are one. Ask thou no more.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Now &rsquo;gin the rueful wailings to be heard.</p>
		<p>Now am I come where many a plaining voice</p>
		<p>Smites on mine ear. Into a place I came</p>
		<p>Where light was silent all. Bellowing there groan&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>A noise as of a sea in tempest torn</p>
		<p>By warring winds. The stormy blast of hell</p>
		<p>With restless fury drives the spirits on</p>
		<p>Whirl&rsquo;d round and dash&rsquo;d amain with sore annoy.</p>
		<p>When they arrive before the ruinous sweep,</p>
		<p>There shrieks are heard, there lamentations, moans,</p>
		<p>And blasphemies &rsquo;gainst the good Power in heaven.</p>
		<p class="slindent">I understood that to this torment sad</p>
		<p>The carnal sinners are condemn&rsquo;d, in whom</p>
		<p>Reason by lust is sway&rsquo;d. As in large troops</p>
		<p>And multitudinous, when winter reigns,</p>
		<p>The starlings on their wings are borne abroad;</p>
		<p>So bears the tyrannous gust those evil souls.</p>
		<p>On this side and on that, above, below,</p>
		<p>It drives them: hope of rest to solace them</p>
		<p>Is none, nor e&rsquo;en of milder pang. As cranes{{2}},</p>
		<p>Chanting their dol&rsquo;rous notes, traverse the sky,</p>
		<p>Stretch&rsquo;d out in long array: so I beheld</p>
		<p>Spirits, who came loud wailing, hurried on</p>
		<p>By their dire doom. Then I: &ldquo;Instructor! who</p>
		<p>Are these, by the black air so scourg&rsquo;d?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;The first</p>
		<p>&rsquo;Mong those, of whom thou question&rsquo;st,&rdquo; he replied,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;O&rsquo;er many tongues was empress. She in vice</p>
		<p>Of luxury was so shameless, that she made</p>
		<p>Liking be lawful by promulg&rsquo;d decree,</p>
		<p>To clear the blame she had herself incurr&rsquo;d.</p>
		<p>This is Semiramis, of whom &rsquo;tis writ,</p>
		<p>That she succeeded Ninus her espous&rsquo;d;</p>
		<p>And held the land{{3}}, which now the Soldan rules.</p>
		<p>The next in amorous fury slew herself,</p>
		<p>And to Sicheus&rsquo; ashes broke her faith:</p>
		<p>Then follows Cleopatra, lustful queen.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">There mark&rsquo;d I Helen, for whose sake so long</p>
		<p>The time was fraught with evil; there the great</p>
		<p>Achilles, who with love fought to the end.</p>
		<p>Paris I saw, and Tristan; and beside</p>
		<p>A thousand more he show&rsquo;d me, and by name</p>
		<p>Pointed them out, whom love bereav&rsquo;d of life.</p>
		<p class="slindent">When I had heard my sage instructor name</p>
		<p>Those dames and knights of antique days, o&rsquo;erpower&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>By pity, well-nigh in amaze my mind</p>
		<p>Was lost; and I began: &ldquo;Bard! willingly</p>
		<p>I would address those two together coming,</p>
		<p>Which seem so light before the wind.&rdquo; He thus:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Note thou, when nearer they to us approach.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Then by that love which carries them along,</p>
		<p>Entreat; and they will come.&rdquo; Soon as the wind</p>
		<p>Sway&rsquo;d them toward us, I thus fram&rsquo;d my speech:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;O wearied spirits! come, and hold discourse</p>
		<p>With us, if by none else restrain&rsquo;d.&rdquo; As doves</p>
		<p>By fond desire invited, on wide wings</p>
		<p>And firm, to their sweet nest returning home,</p>
		<p>Cleave the air, wafted by their will along;</p>
		<p>Thus issu&rsquo;d from that troop, where Dido ranks,</p>
		<p>They through the ill air speeding; with such force</p>
		<p>My cry prevail&rsquo;d by strong affection urg&rsquo;d.</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;O gracious creature and benign! who go&rsquo;st</p>
		<p>Visiting, through this element obscure,</p>
		<p>Us, who the world with bloody stain imbru&rsquo;d;</p>
		<p>If for a friend the King of all we own&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Our pray&rsquo;r to him should for thy peace arise,</p>
		<p>Since thou hast pity on our evil plight.</p>
		<p>()f whatsoe&rsquo;er to hear or to discourse</p>
		<p>It pleases thee, that will we hear, of that</p>
		<p>Freely with thee discourse, while e&rsquo;er the wind,</p>
		<p>As now, is mute. The land, that gave me birth,</p>
		<p>Is situate on the coast, where Po descends</p>
		<p>To rest in ocean with his sequent streams.</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Love, that in gentle heart is quickly learnt{{4}},</p>
		<p>Entangled him by that fair form, from me</p>
		<p>Ta&rsquo;en in such cruel sort, as grieves me still:</p>
		<p>Love, that denial takes from none belov&rsquo;d{{5}},</p>
		<p>Caught me with pleasing him so passing well,</p>
		<p>That, as thou see&rsquo;st, he yet deserts me not.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Love brought us to one death: Caina{{6}} waits</p>
		<p>The soul, who spilt our life.&rdquo; Such were their words;</p>
		<p>At hearing which downward I bent my looks,</p>
		<p>And held them there so long, that the bard cried:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;What art thou pond&rsquo;ring?&rdquo; I in answer thus:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Alas! by what sweet thoughts, what fond desire</p>
		<p>Must they at length to that ill pass have reach&rsquo;d!&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Then turning, I to them my speech address&rsquo;d.</p>
		<p>And thus began: &ldquo;Francesca{{7}}! your sad fate</p>
		<p>Even to tears my grief and pity moves.</p>
		<p>But tell me; in the time of your sweet sighs,</p>
		<p>By what, and how love granted, that ye knew</p>
		<p>Your yet uncertain wishes?&rdquo; She replied:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;No greater grief than to remember days</p>

		<p>Thy learn&rsquo;d instructor. Yet so eagerly</p>
		<p>If thou art bent to know the primal root,</p>
		<p>From whence our love gat being, I will do,</p>
		<p>As one, who weeps and tells his tale. One day</p>
		<p>For our delight we read of Lancelot{{9}},</p>
		<p>How him love thrall&rsquo;d. Alone we were, and no</p>
		<p>Suspicion near us. Ofttimes by that reading</p>
		<p>Our eyes were drawn together, and the hue</p>
		<p>Fled from our alter&rsquo;d cheek. But at one point{{10}}</p>
		<p>Alone we fell. When of that smile we read,</p>
		<p>The wished smile, rapturously kiss&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>By one so deep in love, then he, who ne&rsquo;er</p>
		<p>From me shall separate, at once my lips</p>
		<p>All trembling kiss&rsquo;d. The book and writer both</p>
		<p>Were love&rsquo;s purveyors. In its leaves that day</p>
		<p>We read no more.&rdquo; While thus one spirit spake,</p>
		<p>The other wail&rsquo;d so sorely, that heartstruck</p>
		<p>I through compassion fainting, seem&rsquo;d not far</p>
		<p>From death, and like a corpse fell to the ground{{11}}.</p>

		<p>Soe&rsquo;er I move, or turn, or bend my sight.</p>
		<p>In the third circle I arrive, of show&rsquo;rs</p>
		<p>Ceaseless, accursed, heavy, and cold, unchang&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>For ever, both in kind and in degree.</p>
		<p>Large hail, discolour&rsquo;d water, sleety flaw</p>
		<p>Through the dun midnight air stream&rsquo;d down amain:</p>
		<p>Stank all the land whereon that tempest fell.</p>
		<p class="slindent">Cerberus, cruel monster, fierce and strange,</p>

		<p>Under the rainy deluge, with one side</p>
		<p>The other screening, oft they roll them round,</p>
		<p>A wretched, godless crew. When that great worm{{2}}</p>
		<p>Descried us, savage Cerberus, he op&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>His jaws, and the fangs show&rsquo;d us; not a limb</p>
		<p>Of him but trembled. Then my guide, his palms</p>
		<p>Expanding on the ground, thence filled with earth</p>
		<p>Rais&rsquo;d them, and cast it in his ravenous maw.</p>
		<p>E&rsquo;en as a dog, that yelling bays for food</p>
		<p>His keeper, when the morsel comes, lets fall</p>
		<p>His fury, bent alone with eager haste</p>

		<p>Save one, that sudden rais&rsquo;d himself to sit,</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Thy city heap&rsquo;d with envy to the brim,</p>
		<p>Ay that the measure overflows its bounds,</p>
		<p>Held me in brighter days. Ye citizens</p>

		<p>More from thee, farther parley still entreat.</p>
		<p>Of Farinata and Tegghiaio{{10}} say,</p>
		<p>They who so well deserv&rsquo;d, of Giacopo{{11}},</p>
		<p>Arrigo, Mosca{{12}}, and the rest, who bent</p>
		<p>Their minds on working good. Oh! tell me where</p>
		<p>They bide, and to their knowledge let me come.</p>
		<p>For I am press&rsquo;d with keen desire to hear,</p>
		<p>If heaven&rsquo;s sweet cup or poisonous drug of hell</p>
		<p>Be to their lip assign&rsquo;d.&rdquo; He answer&rsquo;d straight:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;These are yet blacker spirits. Various crimes</p>
		<p>Have sunk them deeper in the dark abyss.</p>
		<p>If thou so far descendest, thou mayst see them.</p>
		<p>But to the pleasant world when thou return&rsquo;st,</p>
		<p>Of me make mention, I entreat thee, there.</p>
		<p>No more I tell thee, answer thee no more.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">This said, his fixed eyes he turn&rsquo;d askance,</p>
		<p>A little ey&rsquo;d me, then bent down his head,</p>
		<p>And &rsquo;midst his blind companions with it fell.</p>
		<p class="slindent">When thus my guide: &ldquo;No more his bed he leaves,</p>
		<p>Ere the last angel-trumpet blow. The Power</p>
		<p>Adverse to these shall then in glory come,</p>
		<p>Each one forthwith to his sad tomb repair,</p>
		<p>Resume his fleshly vesture and his form,</p>
		<p>And hear the eternal doom re-echoing rend</p>
		<p>The vault.&rdquo; So pass&rsquo;d we through that mixture foul</p>
		<p>Of spirits and rain, with tardy steps; meanwhile</p>
		<p>Touching, though slightly, on the life to come.</p>
		<p>For thus I question&rsquo;d: &ldquo;Shall these tortures, Sir!</p>
		<p>When the great sentence passes, be increas&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Or mitigated, or as now severe?&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">He then: &ldquo;Consult thy knowledge{{13}}; that decides</p>
		<p>That as each thing to more perfection grows,</p>
		<p>It feels more sensibly both good and pain.</p>
		<p>Though ne&rsquo;er to true perfection may arrive</p>
		<p>This race accurs&rsquo;d, yet nearer then than now</p>
		<p>They shall approach it.&rdquo; Compassing that path</p>
		<p>Circuitous we journeyed, and discourse</p>
		<p>Much more than I relate between us pass&rsquo;d:</p>
		<p>Till at the point, where the steps led below,</p>
		<p>Arriv&rsquo;d, there Plutus, the great foe, we found.</p>
		</div>`,

		`<p class="cantohead">Canto VII</p>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Ah</span> me! O Satan! Satan!{{1}}&rdquo; loud exclaim&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Plutus, in accent hoarse of wild alarm:</p>
		<p>And the kind sage, whom no event surpris&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>To comfort me thus spake: &ldquo;Let not thy fear</p>
		<p>Harm thee, for power in him, be sure, is none</p>
		<p>To hinder down this rock thy safe descent.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Then to that sworn lip turning, &ldquo;Peace!&rdquo; he cried,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Curs&rsquo;d wolf! thy fury inward on thyself</p>
		<p>Prey, and consume thee! Through the dark profound</p>
		<p>Not without cause he passes. So &rsquo;t is will&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>On high, there where the great Archangel pour&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Heav&rsquo;n&rsquo;s vengeance on the first adulterer proud{{2}}.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">As sails full spread and bellying with the wind</p>
		<p>Drop suddenly collaps&rsquo;d, if the mast split;</p>
		<p>So to the ground down dropp&rsquo;d the cruel fiend.</p>
		<p class="slindent">Thus we, descending to the fourth steep ledge,</p>
		<p>Gain&rsquo;d on the dismal shore, that all the woe</p>
		<p>Hems in of all the universe. Ah me!</p>
		<p>Almighty Justice! in what store thou heap&rsquo;st</p>
		<p>New pains, new troubles, as I here beheld!</p>
		<p>Wherefore doth fault of ours bring us to this?</p>
		<p class="slindent">E&rsquo;en as a billow{{3}}, on Charybdis rising,</p>
		<p>Against encounter&rsquo;d billow dashing breaks;</p>
		<p>Such is the dance this wretched race must lead,</p>
		<p>Whom more than elsewhere numerous here I found,</p>
		<p>From one side and the other, with loud voice,</p>
		<p>Both roll&rsquo;d on weights by main forge of their breasts,</p>
		<p>Then smote together, and each one forthwith</p>
		<p>Roll&rsquo;d them back voluble, turning again,</p>
		<p>Exclaiming these, &ldquo;Why holdest thou so fast?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Those answering, &ldquo;And why castest thou away?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>So still repeating their despiteful song,</p>
		<p>They to the opposite point on either hand</p>
		<p>Travers&rsquo;d the horrid circle: then arriv&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Both turn&rsquo;d them round, and through the middle space</p>
		<p>Conflicting met again. At sight whereof</p>
		<p>I, stung with grief, thus spake: &ldquo;O say, my guide!</p>
		<p>What race is this? Were these, whose heads are shorn,</p>
		<p>On our left hand, all sep&rsquo;rate to the church?&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">He straight replied: &ldquo;In their first life these all</p>
		<p>In mind were so distorted, that they made,</p>
		<p>According to due measure, of their wealth,</p>
		<p>No use. This clearly from their words collect,</p>
		<p>Which they howl forth, at each extremity</p>
		<p>Arriving of the circle, where their crime</p>
		<p>Contrary&rsquo; in kind disparts them. To the church</p>
		<p>Were separate those, that with no hairy cowls</p>
		<p>Are crown&rsquo;d, both Popes and Cardinals{{4}}, o&rsquo;er whom</p>
		<p>Av&rsquo;rice dominion absolute maintains.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">I then: &ldquo;Mid such as these some needs must be,</p>
		<p>Whom I shall recognize, that with the blot</p>
		<p>Of these foul sins were stain&rsquo;d.&rdquo; He answering thus:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Vain thought conceiv&rsquo;st thou. That ignoble life,</p>
		<p>Which made them vile before, now makes them dark,</p>
		<p>And to all knowledge indiscernible.</p>
		<p>Forever they shall meet in this rude shock:</p>
		<p>These from the tomb with clenched grasp shall rise,</p>
		<p>Those with close-shaven locks. That ill they gave,</p>
		<p>And ill they kept, hath of the beauteous world</p>
		<p>Depriv&rsquo;d, and set them at this strife, which needs</p>
		<p>No labour&rsquo;d phrase of mine to set if off.</p>
		<p>Now may&rsquo;st thou see, my son! how brief, how vain,</p>
		<p>The goods committed into fortune&rsquo;s hands,</p>
		<p>For which the human race keep such a coil!</p>
		<p>Not all the gold, that is beneath the moon,</p>
		<p>Or ever hath been, of these toil-worn souls</p>
		<p>Might purchase rest for one.&rdquo; I thus rejoin&rsquo;d:</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;My guide! of thee this also would I learn;</p>
		<p>This fortune, that thou speak&rsquo;st of, what it is,</p>
		<p>Whose talons grasp the blessings of the world?&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">He thus: &ldquo;O beings blind! what ignorance</p>
		<p>Besets you? Now my judgment hear and mark.</p>
		<p>He, whose transcendent wisdom passes all,</p>
		<p>The heavens creating, gave them ruling powers</p>
		<p>To guide them, so that each part shines to each,</p>
		<p>Their light in equal distribution pour&rsquo;d.</p>
		<p>By similar appointment he ordain&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Over the world&rsquo;s bright images to rule.</p>
		<p>Superintendence of a guiding hand</p>
		<p>And general minister, which at due time</p>
		<p>May change the empty vantages of life</p>
		<p>From race to race, from one to other&rsquo;s blood,</p>
		<p>Beyond prevention of man&rsquo;s wisest care:</p>
		<p>Wherefore one nation rises into sway,</p>
		<p>Another languishes, e&rsquo;en as her will</p>
		<p>Decrees, from us conceal&rsquo;d, as in the grass</p>
		<p>The serpent train. Against her nought avails</p>
		<p>Your utmost wisdom. She with foresight plans,</p>
		<p>Judges, and carries on her reign, as theirs</p>
		<p>The other powers divine. Her changes know</p>
		<p>Nore intermission: by necessity{{5}}</p>
		<p>She is made swift, so frequent come who claim</p>
		<p>Succession in her favours. This is she,</p>
		<p>So execrated e&rsquo;en by those, whose debt</p>
		<p>To her is rather praise; they wrongfully</p>
		<p>With blame requite her, and with evil word;</p>
		<p>But she is blessed, and for that recks not:</p>
		<p>Amidst the other primal beings glad</p>
		<p>Rolls on her sphere, and in her bliss exults.</p>
		<p>Now on our way pass we, to heavier woe</p>
		<p>Descending: for each star is falling now,</p>
		<p>That mounted at our entrance, and forbids</p>
		<p>Too long our tarrying.&rdquo; We the circle cross&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>To the next steep, arriving at a well,</p>
		<p>That boiling pours itself down to a foss</p>
		<p>Sluic&rsquo;d from its source. Far murkier was the wave</p>
		<p>Than sablest grain: and we in company</p>
		<p>Of the&rsquo; inky waters, journeying by their side,</p>
		<p>Enter&rsquo;d, though by a different track, beneath.</p>
		<p>Into a lake, the Stygian nam&rsquo;d, expands</p>
		<p>The dismal stream, when it hath reach&rsquo;d the foot</p>
		<p>Of the grey wither&rsquo;d cliffs. Intent I stood</p>
		<p>To gaze, and in the marish sunk descried</p>
		<p>A miry tribe, all naked, and with looks</p>
		<p>Betok&rsquo;ning rage. They with their hands alone</p>
		<p>Struck not, but with the head, the breast, the feet,</p>
		<p>Cutting each other piecemeal with their fangs.</p>
		<p class="slindent">The good instructor spake; &ldquo;Now seest thou, son!</p>
		<p>The souls of those, whom anger overcame.</p>
		<p>This too for certain know, that underneath</p>
		<p>The water dwells a multitude, whose sighs</p>
		<p>Into these bubbles make the surface heave,</p>
		<p>As thine eye tells thee wheresoe&rsquo;er it turn.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Fix&rsquo;d in the slime they say: &ldquo;Sad once were we</p>
		<p>In the sweet air made gladsome by the sun,</p>
		<p>Carrying a foul and lazy mist within:</p>
		<p>Now in these murky settlings are we sad.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Such dolorous strain they gurgle in their throats.</p>
		<p>But word distinct can utter none.&rdquo; Our route</p>
		<p>Thus compass&rsquo;d we, a segment widely stretch&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Between the dry embankment, and the core</p>
		<p>Of the loath&rsquo;d pool, turning meanwhile our eyes</p>
		<p>Downward on those who gulp&rsquo;d its muddy lees;</p>
		<p>Nor stopp&rsquo;d, till to a tower&rsquo;s low base we came.</p>
		</div>`,

		`<p class="cantohead">Canto VIII</p>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p><span class="sc">My</span> theme pursuing, I relate that ere</p>
		<p>We reach&rsquo;d the lofty turret&rsquo;s base, our eyes</p>
		<p>Its height ascended, where two cressets hung</p>
		<p>We mark&rsquo;d, and from afar another light</p>
		<p>Return the signal, so remote, that scarce</p>
		<p>The eye could catch its beam. I turning round</p>
		<p>To the deep source of knowledge, thus inquir&rsquo;d:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Say what this means? and what that other light</p>
		<p>In answer set? what agency doth this?&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;There on the filthy waters,&rdquo; he replied,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;E&rsquo;en now what next awaits us mayst thou see,</p>
		<p>If the marsh-gender&rsquo;d fog conceal it not.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Never was arrow from the cord dismiss&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>That ran its way so nimbly through the air,</p>
		<p>As a small bark, that through the waves I spied</p>
		<p>Toward us coming, under the sole sway</p>
		<p>Of one that ferried it, who cried aloud:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Art thou arriv&rsquo;d, fell spirit?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Phlegyas, Phlegyas,</p>
		<p>This time thou criest in vain,&rdquo; my lord replied;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;No longer shalt thou have us, but while o&rsquo;er</p>
		<p>The slimy pool we pass.&rdquo; As one who hears</p>
		<p>Of some great wrong he hath sustain&rsquo;d, whereat</p>
		<p>Inly he pines; so Phlegyas{{1}} inly pin&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>In his fierce ire. My guide descending stepp&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Into the skiff, and bade me enter next</p>
		<p>Close at his side; nor till my entrance seem&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>The vessel freighted. Soon as both embark&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Cutting the waves, goes on the ancient prow,</p>
		<p>More deeply than with others it is wont.</p>
		<p class="slindent">While we our course o&rsquo;er the dead channel held.</p>
		<p>One drench&rsquo;d in mire before me came, and said;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Who art thou, that thou comest ere thine hour?&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">I answer&rsquo;d: &ldquo;Though I come, I tarry not;</p>
		<p>But who art thou, that art become so foul?&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;One, as thou seest, who mourn:&rdquo; he straight replied.</p>
		<p class="slindent">To which I thus: &ldquo;In mourning and in woe,</p>
		<p>Curs&rsquo;d spirit! tarry thou.g I know thee well,</p>
		<p>E&rsquo;en thus in filth disguis&rsquo;d.&rdquo; Then stretch&rsquo;d he forth</p>
		<p>Hands to the bark; whereof my teacher sage</p>
		<p>Aware, thrusting him back: &ldquo;Away! down there;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;To the&rsquo; other dogs!&rdquo; then, with his arms my neck</p>
		<p>Encircling, kiss&rsquo;d my cheek, and spake: &ldquo;O soul</p>
		<p>Justly disdainful! blest was she in whom</p>
		<p>Thou was conceiv&rsquo;d! He in the world was one</p>
		<p>For arrogance noted; to his memory</p>
		<p>No virtue lends its lustre; even so</p>
		<p>Here is his shadow furious. There above</p>
		<p>How many now hold themselves mighty kings</p>
		<p>Who here like swine shall wallow in the mire,</p>
		<p>Leaving behind them horrible dispraise!&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">I then: &ldquo;Master! him fain would I behold</p>
		<p>Whelm&rsquo;d in these dregs, before we quit the lake.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">He thus: &ldquo;Or ever to thy view the shore</p>
		<p>Be offer&rsquo;d, satisfied shall be that wish,</p>
		<p>Which well deserves completion.&rdquo; Scarce his words</p>
		<p>Were ended, when I saw the miry tribes</p>
		<p>Set on him with such violence, that yet</p>
		<p>For that render I thanks to God and praise</p>
		<p>&ldquo;To Filippo Argenti{{2}}:&rdquo; cried they all:</p>
		<p>And on himself the moody Florentine</p>
		<p>Turn&rsquo;d his avenging fangs. Him here we left,</p>
		<p>Nor speak I of him more. But on mine ear</p>
		<p>Sudden a sound of lamentation smote,</p>
		<p>Whereat mine eye unbarr&rsquo;d I sent abroad.</p>
		<p class="slindent">And thus the good instructor: &ldquo;Now, my son!</p>
		<p>Draws near the city, that of Dis is nam&rsquo;d{{3}},</p>
		<p>With its grave denizens, a mighty throng.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">I thus: &ldquo;The minarets already, Sir!</p>
		<p>There certes in the valley I descry,</p>
		<p>Gleaming vermilion, as if they from fire</p>
		<p>Had issu&rsquo;d.&rdquo; He replied: &ldquo;Eternal fire,</p>
		<p>That inward burns, shows them with ruddy flame</p>
		<p>Illum&rsquo;d; as in this nether hell thou seest.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">We came within the fosses deep, that moat</p>
		<p>This region comfortless. The walls appear&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>As they were fram&rsquo;d of iron. We had made</p>
		<p>Wide circuit, ere a place we reach&rsquo;d, where loud</p>
		<p>The mariner cried vehement: &ldquo;Go forth!</p>
		<p>The&rsquo; entrance is here!&rdquo; Upon the gates I spied</p>
		<p>More than a thousand, who of old from heaven</p>
		<p>Were hurl&rsquo;d. With ireful gestures, &ldquo;Who is this,&rdquo;</p>
		<p>They cried, &ldquo;that without death first felt, goes through</p>
		<p>The regions of the dead?&rdquo; My sapient guide</p>
		<p>Made sign that he for secret parley wish&rsquo;d;</p>
		<p>Whereat their angry scorn abating, thus</p>
		<p>They spake: &ldquo;Come thou alone; and let him go</p>
		<p>Who hath so hardily enter&rsquo;d this realm.</p>
		<p>Alone return he by his witless way;</p>
		<p>If well he know it, let him prove. For thee,</p>
		<p>Here shalt thou tarry, who through clime so dark</p>
		<p>Hast been his escort.&rdquo; Now bethink thee, reader!</p>
		<p>What cheer was mine at sound of those curs&rsquo;d words.</p>
		<p>I did believe I never should return.</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;O my lov&rsquo;d guide! who more than seven times{{4}}</p>
		<p>Security hast render&rsquo;d me, and drawn</p>
		<p>From peril deep, whereto I stood expos&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Desert me not,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;in this extreme.</p>
		<p>And if our onward going be denied,</p>
		<p>Together trace we back our steps with speed.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">My liege, who thither had conducted me,</p>
		<p>Replied: &ldquo;Fear not: for of our passage none</p>
		<p>Hath power to disappoint us, by such high</p>
		<p>Authority permitted. But do thou</p>
		<p>Expect me here; meanwhile thy wearied spirit</p>
		<p>Comfort, and feed with kindly hope, assur&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>I will not leave thee in this lower world.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">This said, departs the sire benevolent,</p>
		<p>And quits me. Hesitating I remain</p>
		<p>At war &rsquo;twixt will and will not{{5}} in my thoughts.</p>
		<p class="slindent">I could not hear what terms he offer&rsquo;d them,</p>
		<p>But they conferr&rsquo;d not long, for all at once</p>
		<p>To trial fled within. Clos&rsquo;d were the gates</p>
		<p>By those our adversaries on the breast</p>
		<p>Of my liege lord: excluded he return&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>To me with tardy steps. Upon the ground</p>
		<p>His eyes were bent, and from his brow eras&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>All confidence, while thus with sighs he spake:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Who hath denied me these abodes of woe?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Then thus to me: &ldquo;That I am anger&rsquo;d, think</p>
		<p>No ground of terror: in this trial I</p>

		<p>For hindrance. This their insolence, not new,{{6}}</p>
		<p>Erewhile at gate less secret they display&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Which still is without bolt; upon its arch</p>
		<p>Thou saw&rsquo;st the deadly scroll: and even now</p>
		<p>On this side of its entrance, down the steep,</p>

		`<p class="cantohead">Canto IX</p>

		<p><span class="sc">The</span> hue{{1}}, which coward dread on my pale cheeks</p>
		<p>Imprinted, when I saw my guide turn back,</p>
		<p>Chas&rsquo;d that from his which newly they had worn,</p>
		<p>And inwardly restrain&rsquo;d it. He, as one</p>
		<p>Who listens, stood attentive: for his eye</p>
		<p>Not far could lead him through the sable air,</p>
		<p>And the thick-gath&rsquo;ring cloud. &ldquo;It yet behooves</p>
		<p>We win this fight&rdquo;&mdash;thus he began&mdash;&ldquo;if not&mdash;</p>
		<p>Such aid to us is offer&rsquo;d.&mdash;Oh, how long</p>

		<p class="slindent">I noted, how the sequel of his words</p>
		<p>Clok&rsquo;d their beginning; for the last he spake</p>
		<p>Agreed not with the first. But not the less</p>
		<p>My fear was at his saying; sith I drew</p>
		<p>To import worse perchance, than that he held,</p>
		<p>His mutilated speech. &ldquo;Doth ever any</p>
		<p>Into this rueful concave&rsquo;s extreme depth</p>
		<p>Descend, out of the first degree, whose pain</p>
		<p>Is deprivation merely of sweet hope?&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Thus I inquiring. &ldquo;Rarely,&rdquo; he replied,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It chances, that among us any makes</p>
		<p>This journey, which I wend. Erewhile &rsquo;tis true</p>
		<p>Once came I here beneath, conjur&rsquo;d by fell</p>
		<p>Erictho{{2}}, sorceress, who compell&rsquo;d the shades</p>
		<p>Back to their bodies. No long space my flesh</p>
		<p>Was naked of me{{3}}, when within these walls</p>
		<p>She made me enter, to draw forth a spirit</p>
		<p>From out of Judas&rsquo; circle. Lowest place</p>
		<p>Is that of all, obscurest, and remov&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Farthest from heav&rsquo;n&rsquo;s all-circling orb. The road</p>
		<p>Full well I know: thou therefore rest secure.</p>
		<p>That lake, the noisome stench exhaling, round</p>
		<p>The city&rsquo; of grief encompasses, which now</p>
		<p>We may not enter without rage.&rdquo; Yet more</p>
		<p>He added: but I hold it not in mind,</p>
		<p>For that mine eye toward the lofty tower</p>
		<p>Had drawn me wholly, to its burning top.</p>
		<p>Where in an instant I beheld uprisen</p>
		<p>At once three hellish furies stain&rsquo;d with blood:</p>
		<p>In limb and motion feminine they seem&rsquo;d;</p>
		<p>Around them greenest hydras twisting roll&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Their volumes; adders and cerastes{{4}} crept</p>
		<p>Instead of hair, and their fierce temples bound.</p>
		<p class="slindent">He knowing well the miserable hags</p>
		<p>Who tend the queen of endless woe, thus spake:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Mark thou each dire Erinnys. To the left</p>
		<p>This is Megaera; on the right hand she,</p>
		<p>Who wails, Alecto; and Tisiphone</p>

		<p>Their breast they each one clawing tore; themselves</p>
		<p>Smote with their palms, and such shrill clamour rais&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>That to the bard I clung, suspicion-bound.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Hasten Medusa: so to adamant</p>
		<p>Him shall we change;&rdquo; all looking down exclaim&rsquo;d.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;e&rsquo;en when by Theseus&rsquo; might assail&rsquo;d, we took</p>
		<p>No ill revenge.&rdquo; &ldquo;Turn thyself round, and keep</p>
		<p>Thy count&rsquo;nance hid; for if the Gorgon dire</p>
		<p>Be shown, and thou shouldst view it, thy return</p>
		<p>Upwards would be for ever lost.&rdquo; This said,</p>
		<p>Himself my gentle master turn&rsquo;d me round,</p>
		<p>Nor trusted he my hands, but with his own</p>
		<p>He also hid me. Ye of intellect</p>
		<p>Sound and entire, mark well the lore conceal&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Under close texture of the mystic strain!</p>
		<p class="slindent">And now there came o&rsquo;er the perturbed waves</p>
		<p>Loud-crashing, terrible, a sound that made</p>

		<p>Its whirlwind rage, while beasts and shepherds fly.</p>
		<p class="slindent">Mine eyes he loos&rsquo;d, and spake: &ldquo;And now direct</p>
		<p>Thy visual nerve along that ancient foam,</p>

		<p>Before their foe the serpent, through the wave</p>
		<p>Ply swiftly all, till at the ground each one</p>
		<p>Lies on a heap; more than a thousand spirits</p>
		<p>Destroy&rsquo;d, so saw I fleeing before one</p>
		<p>Who pass&rsquo;d with unwet feet the Stygian sound.</p>
		<p>He, from his face removing the gross air,</p>
		<p>Oft his left hand forth stretch&rsquo;d, and seem&rsquo;d alone</p>
		<p>By that annoyance wearied. I perceiv&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>That he was sent from heav&rsquo;n, and to my guide</p>
		<p>Turn&rsquo;d me, who signal made that I should stand</p>
		<p>Quiet, and bend to him. Ah me! how full</p>
		<p>Of noble anger seem&rsquo;d he! To the gate</p>
		<p>He came, and with his wand{{6}} touch&rsquo;d it, whereat</p>
		<p>Open without impediment it flew.</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Outcasts of heav&rsquo;n! O abject race and scorn&rsquo;d!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Began he on the horrid grunsel standing,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Whence doth this wild excess of insolence</p>
		<p>Lodge in you? wherefore kick you &rsquo;gainst that will</p>

		<p>What profits at the fays to but the horn?{{7}}</p>
		<p>Your Cerberus{{8}}, if ye remember, hence</p>
		<p>Bears still, peel&rsquo;d of their hair, his throat and maw.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">This said, he turn&rsquo;d back o&rsquo;er the filthy way,</p>
		<p>And syllable to us spake none, but wore</p>
		<p>The semblance of a man by other care</p>
		<p>Beset, and keenly press&rsquo;d, than thought of him</p>
		<p>Who in his presence stands. Then we our steps</p>
		<p>Toward that territory mov&rsquo;d, secure</p>
		<p>After the hallow&rsquo;d words. We unoppos&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>There enter&rsquo;d; and my mind eager to learn</p>
		<p>What state a fortress like to that might hold,</p>
		<p>I soon as enter&rsquo;d throw mine eye around,</p>
		<p>And see on every part wide-stretching space</p>
		<p>Replete with bitter pain and torment ill.</p>
		<p class="slindent">As where Rhone stagnates on the plains of Arles{{9}},</p>
		<p>Or as at Pola{{10}}, near Quarnaro&rsquo;s gulf,</p>
		<p>That closes Italy and laves her bounds,</p>
		<p>The place is all thick spread with sepulchres;</p>
		<p>So was it here, save what in horror here</p>
		<p>Excell&rsquo;d: for &rsquo;midst the graves were scattered flames,</p>
		<p>Wherewith intensely all throughout they burn&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>That iron for no craft there hotter needs.</p>
		<p class="slindent">Their lids all hung suspended, and beneath</p>
		<p>From them forth issu&rsquo;d lamentable moans,</p>
		<p>Such as the sad and tortur&rsquo;d well might raise.</p>
		<p class="slindent">I thus: &ldquo;Master! say who are these, interr&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Within these vaults, of whom distinct we hear</p>
		<p>The dolorous sighs?&rdquo; He answer thus return&rsquo;d:</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;The arch-heretics are here, accompanied</p>
		<p>By every sect their followers; and much more,</p>
		<p>Than thou believest, tombs are freighted: like</p>
		<p>With like is buried; and the monuments</p>
		<p>Are different in degrees of heat.&rdquo; This said,</p>
		<p>He to the right hand turning, on we pass&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Betwixt the afflicted and the ramparts high.</p>

		<p><span class="sc">Now</span> by a secret pathway we proceed,</p>
		<p>Between the walls, that hem the region round,</p>
		<p>And the tormented souls: my master first,</p>
		<p>I close behind his steps. &ldquo;Virtue supreme!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>I thus began; &ldquo;who through these ample orbs</p>
		<p>In circuit lead&rsquo;st me, even as thou will&rsquo;st,</p>

		<p>Already all the lids are rais&rsquo;d, and none</p>

		<p>&ldquo;They shall be closed all, what-time they here</p>

		<p>Here therefore satisfaction shall be soon</p>
		<p>Both to the question ask&rsquo;d, and to the wish,</p>
		<p>Which thou conceal&rsquo;st in silence.&rdquo; I replied:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I keep not, guide belov&rsquo;d! from thee my heart</p>
		<p>Secreted, but to shun vain length of words,</p>
		<p>A lesson erewhile taught me by thyself.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;O Tuscan! thou who through the city of fire</p>
		<p>Alive art passing, so discreet of speech!</p>
		<p>Here please thee stay awhile. Thy utterance</p>
		<p>Declares the place of thy nativity</p>
		<p>To be that noble land, with which perchance</p>
		<p>I too severely dealt.&rdquo; Sudden that sound</p>
		<p>Forth issu&rsquo;d from a vault, whereat in fear</p>
		<p>I somewhat closer to my leader&rsquo;s side</p>
		<p>Approaching, he thus spake: &ldquo;What dost thou? Turn.</p>
		<p>Lo, Farinata{{2}}, there! who hath himself</p>
		<p>Uplifted: from his girdle upwards all</p>
		<p>Expos&rsquo;d behold him.&rdquo; On his face was mine</p>
		<p>Already fix&rsquo;d; his breast and forehead there</p>
		<p>Erecting, seem&rsquo;d as in high scorn he held</p>
		<p>E&rsquo;en hell. Between the sepulchres to him</p>
		<p>My guide thrust me with fearless hands and prompt,</p>
		<p>This warning added: &ldquo;See thy words be clear!&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">He, soon as there I stood at the tomb&rsquo;s foot,</p>
		<p>Ey&rsquo;d me a space, then in disdainful mood</p>
		<p>Address&rsquo;d me: &ldquo;Say, what ancestors were thine?&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">I, willing to obey him, straight reveal&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>The whole, nor kept back aught: whence he, his brow</p>
		<p>Somewhat uplifting, cried: &ldquo;Fiercely were they</p>
		<p>Adverse to me, my party, and the blood</p>
		<p>From whence I sprang: twice therefore I abroad</p>
		<p>Scatter&rsquo;d them.&rdquo; &ldquo;Though driv&rsquo;n out, yet they each time</p>
		<p>From all parts,&rdquo; answer&rsquo;d I, &ldquo;return&rsquo;d; an art</p>
		<p>Which yours have shown, they are not skill&rsquo;d to learn.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Then, peering forth from the unclosed jaw,</p>
		<p>Rose from his side a shade{{3}}, high as the chin,</p>
		<p>Leaning, methought, upon its knees uprais&rsquo;d.</p>
		<p>It look&rsquo;d around, as eager to explore</p>
		<p>If there were other with me; but perceiving</p>
		<p>That fond imagination quench&rsquo;d, with tears</p>
		<p>Thus spake: &ldquo;If thou through this blind prison go&rsquo;st.</p>
		<p>Led by thy lofty genius and profound,</p>
		<p>Where is my son{{4}}? and wherefore not with thee?&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">I straight replied: &ldquo;Not of myself I come,</p>
		<p>By him, who there expects me, through this clime</p>
		<p>Conducted, whom perchance Guido thy son</p>
		<p>Had in contempt{{5}}.&rdquo; Already had his words</p>
		<p>And mode of punishment read me his name,</p>
		<p>Whence I so fully answer&rsquo;d. He at once</p>
		<p>Exclaim&rsquo;d, up starting, &ldquo;How! said&rsquo;st thou he had{{6}}?</p>
		<p>No longer lives he? Strikes not on his eye</p>
		<p>The blessed daylight?&rdquo; Then of some delay</p>
		<p>I made ere my reply aware, down fell</p>
		<p>Supine, not after forth appear&rsquo;d he more.</p>
		<p class="slindent">Meanwhile the other, great of soul, near whom</p>
		<p>I yet was station&rsquo;d, chang&rsquo;d not count&rsquo;nance stern,</p>
		<p>Nor mov&rsquo;d the neck, nor bent his ribbed side.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;And if,&rdquo; continuing the first discourse,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;They in this art,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;small skill have shown,</p>
		<p>That doth torment me more e&rsquo;en than this bed.</p>
		<p>But not yet fifty times{{7}} shall be relum&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Her aspect, who reigns here Queen of this realm,</p>
		<p>Ere thou shalt know the full weight of that art.</p>
		<p>So to the pleasant world mayst thou return,</p>
		<p>As thou shalt tell me, why in all their laws,</p>
		<p>Against my kin this people is so fell?&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;The slaughter{{8}} and great havoc,&rdquo; I replied,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;That colour&rsquo;d Arbia&rsquo;s flood with crimson stain&mdash;</p>
		<p>To these impute, that in our hallow&rsquo;d dome</p>
		<p>Such orisons{{9}} ascend.&rdquo; Sighing he shook</p>
		<p>The head, then thus resum&rsquo;d: &ldquo;In that affray</p>
		<p>I stood not singly, nor without just cause</p>
		<p>Assuredly should with the rest have stirr&rsquo;d;</p>
		<p>But singly there I stood{{10}}, when by consent</p>
		<p>Of all, Florence had to the ground been raz&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>The one who openly forbad the deed.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;So may thy lineage find at last repose,&rdquo;</p>
		<p>I thus adjur&rsquo;d him, &ldquo;as thou solve this knot,</p>
		<p>Which now involves my mind. If right I hear,</p>
		<p>Ye seem to view beforehand, that which time</p>
		<p>Leads with him, of the present uninform&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;We view, as one who hath an evil sight,&rdquo;</p>
		<p>He answer&rsquo;d, &ldquo;plainly, objects far remote:</p>
		<p>So much of his large spendour yet imparts</p>
		<p>The&rsquo; Almighty Ruler; but when they approach</p>
		<p>Or actually exist, our intellect</p>
		<p>Then wholly fails, nor of your human state</p>
		<p>Except what others bring us know we aught.</p>
		<p>Hence therefore mayst thou understand, that all</p>
		<p>Our knowledge in that instant shall expire,</p>
		<p>When on futurity the portals close.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Then conscious of my fault{{11}}, and by remorse</p>
		<p>Smitten, I added thus: &ldquo;Now shalt thou say</p>
		<p>To him there fallen, that his offspring still</p>
		<p>Is to the living join&rsquo;d; and bid him know,</p>
		<p>That if from answer silent I abstain&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>&rsquo;Twas that my thought was occupied intent</p>
		<p>Upon that error, which thy help hath solv&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">But now my master summoning me back</p>
		<p>I heard, and with more eager haste besought</p>
		<p>The spirit to inform me, who with him</p>
		<p>Partook his lot. He answer thus return&rsquo;d:</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;More than a thousand with me here are laid</p>
		<p>Within is Frederick{{12}}, second of that name,</p>
		<p>And the Lord Cardinal{{13}}, and of the rest</p>
		<p>I speak not.&rdquo; He, this said, from sight withdrew.</p>
		<p>But I my steps towards the ancient bard</p>
		<p>Reverting, ruminated on the words</p>
		<p>Betokening me such ill. Onward he mov&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>And thus in going question&rsquo;d: &ldquo;Whence the&rsquo; amaze</p>
		<p>That holds thy senses wrapt?&rdquo; I satisfied</p>
		<p>The&rsquo; inquiry, and the sage enjoin&rsquo;d me straight:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Let thy safe memory store what thou hast heard</p>
		<p>To thee importing harm; and note thou this,&rdquo;</p>
		<p>With his rais&rsquo;d finger bidding me take heed,</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;When thou shalt stand before her gracious beam{{14}},</p>
		<p>Whose bright eye all surveys, she of thy life</p>
		<p>The future tenour will to thee unfold.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Forthwith he to the left hand turn&rsquo;d his feet:</p>
		<p>We left the wall, and tow&rsquo;rds the middle space</p>
		<p>Went by a path, that to a valley strikes;</p>
		<p>Which e&rsquo;en thus high exhal&rsquo;d its noisome steam.</p>

		`<p class="cantohead">Canto XI</p>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p><span class="sc">Upon</span> the utmost verge of a high bank,</p>
		<p>By craggy rocks environ&rsquo;d round, we came,</p>
		<p>Where woes beneath more cruel yet were stow&rsquo;d:</p>
		<p>And here to shun the horrible excess</p>
		<p>Of fetid exhalation, upward cast</p>
		<p>From the profound abyss, behind the lid</p>
		<p>Of a great monument we stood retir&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Whereon this scroll I mark&rsquo;d: &ldquo;I have in charge</p>
		<p>Pope Anastasius, whom Photinus drew</p>
		<p>From the right path.&mdash;Ere our descent behooves</p>
		<p>We make delay, that somewhat first the sense,</p>
		<p>To the dire breath accustom&rsquo;d, afterward</p>
		<p>Regard it not.&rdquo; My master thus; to whom</p>
		<p>Answering I spake: &ldquo;Some compensation find</p>
		<p>That the time past not wholly lost.&rdquo; He then:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Lo! how my thoughts e&rsquo;en to thy wishes tend!</p>
		<p>My son! within these rocks,&rdquo; he thus began,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Are three close circles in gradation plac&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>As these which now thou leav&rsquo;st. Each one is full</p>
		<p>Of spirits accurs&rsquo;d; but that the sight alone</p>
		<p>Hereafter may suffice thee, listen how</p>
		<p>And for what cause in durance they abide.</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Of all malicious act abhorr&rsquo;d in heaven,</p>
		<p>The end is injury; and all such end</p>
		<p>Either by force or fraud works other&rsquo;s woe</p>
		<p>But fraud, because of man peculiar evil,</p>
		<p>To God is more displeasing; and beneath</p>
		<p>The fraudulent are therefore doom&rsquo;d to&rsquo; endure</p>
		<p>Severer pang. The violent occupy</p>
		<p>All the first circle; and because to force</p>
		<p>Three persons are obnoxious, in three rounds</p>
		<p>Hach within other sep&rsquo;rate is it fram&rsquo;d.</p>
		<p>To God, his neighbour, and himself, by man</p>
		<p>Force may be offer&rsquo;d; to himself I say</p>
		<p>And his possessions, as thou soon shalt hear</p>
		<p>At full. Death, violent death, and painful wounds</p>
		<p>Upon his neighbour he inflicts; and wastes</p>
		<p>By devastation, pillage, and the flames,</p>
		<p>His substance. Slayers, and each one that smites</p>
		<p>In malice, plund&rsquo;rers, and all robbers, hence</p>
		<p>The torment undergo of the first round</p>
		<p>In different herds. Man can do violence</p>
		<p>To himself and his own blessings: and for this</p>
		<p>He in the second round must aye deplore</p>
		<p>With unavailing penitence his crime,</p>
		<p>Whoe&rsquo;er deprives himself of life and light,</p>
		<p>In reckless lavishment his talent wastes,</p>
		<p>And sorrows there where he should dwell in joy.</p>
		<p>To God may force be offer&rsquo;d, in the heart</p>
		<p>Denying and blaspheming his high power,</p>
		<p>And nature with her kindly law contemning.</p>
		<p>And thence the inmost round marks with its seal</p>
		<p>Sodom and Cahors, and all such as speak</p>
		<p>Contemptuously&rsquo; of the Godhead in their hearts.</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Fraud, that in every conscience leaves a sting,</p>
		<p>May be by man employ&rsquo;d on one, whose trust</p>
		<p>He wins, or on another who withholds</p>
		<p>Strict confidence. Seems as the latter way</p>
		<p>Broke but the bond of love which Nature makes.</p>
		<p>Whence in the second circle have their nest</p>
		<p>Dissimulation, witchcraft, flatteries,</p>
		<p>Theft, falsehood, simony, all who seduce</p>
		<p>To lust, or set their honesty at pawn,</p>
		<p>With such vile scum as these. The other way</p>
		<p>Forgets both Nature&rsquo;s general love, and that</p>
		<p>Which thereto added afterwards gives birth</p>
		<p>To special faith. Whence in the lesser circle,</p>
		<p>Point of the universe, dread seat of Dis,</p>
		<p>The traitor is eternally consum&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">I thus: &ldquo;Instructor, clearly thy discourse</p>

		<p>Or who with tongues so fierce conflicting meet,</p>
		<p>Wherefore within the city fire-illum&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Are not these punish&rsquo;d, if God&rsquo;s wrath be on them?</p>
		<p>And if it be not, wherefore in such guise</p>
		<p>Are they condemned?&rdquo; He answer thus return&rsquo;d:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Wherefore in dotage wanders thus thy mind,</p>
		<p>Not so accustom&rsquo;d? or what other thoughts</p>
		<p>Possess it? Dwell not in thy memory</p>
		<p>The words, wherein thy ethic page describes</p>
		<p>Three dispositions adverse to Heav&rsquo;n&rsquo;s will,</p>
		<p>Incont&rsquo;nence, malice, and mad brutishness,</p>
		<p>And how incontinence the least offends</p>
		<p>God, and least guilt incurs? If well thou note</p>
		<p>This judgment, and remember who they are,</p>
		<p>Without these walls to vain repentance doom&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Thou shalt discern why they apart are plac&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>From these fell spirits, and less wreakful pours</p>
		<p>Justice divine on them its vengeance down.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;O Sun! who healest all imperfect sight,</p>
		<p>Thou so content&rsquo;st me, when thou solv&rsquo;st my doubt,</p>
		<p>That ignorance not less than knowledge charms.</p>
		<p>Yet somewhat turn thee back,&rdquo; I in these words</p>
		<p>Continu&rsquo;d, &ldquo;where thou saidst, that usury</p>
		<p>Offends celestial Goodness; and this knot</p>
		<p>Perplex&rsquo;d unravel.&rdquo; He thus made reply:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Philosophy, to an attentive ear,</p>
		<p>Clearly points out, not in one part alone,</p>
		<p>How imitative nature takes her course</p>
		<p>From the celestial mind and from its art:</p>
		<p>And where her laws the Stagyrite unfolds,</p>
		<p>Not many leaves scann&rsquo;d o&rsquo;er, observing well</p>
		<p>Thou shalt discover, that your art on her</p>
		<p>Obsequious follows, as the learner treads</p>
		<p>In his instructor&rsquo;s step, so that your art</p>
		<p>Deserves the name of second in descent</p>
		<p>From God. These two, if thou recall to mind</p>
		<p>Creation&rsquo;s holy book, from the beginning</p>
		<p>Were the right source of life and excellence</p>
		<p>To human kind. But in another path</p>
		<p>The usurer walks; and Nature in herself</p>
		<p>And in her follower thus he sets at nought,</p>
		<p>Placing elsewhere his hope. But follow now</p>
		<p>My steps on forward journey bent; for now</p>
		<p>The Pisces play with undulating glance</p>
		<p>Along the&rsquo; horizon, and the Wain lies all</p>
		<p>O&rsquo;er the north-west; and onward there a space</p>

		<p>The infamy of Crete, detested brood</p>
		<p>Of the feign&rsquo;d heifer: and at sight of us</p>
		<p>It gnaw&rsquo;d itself, as one with rage distract.</p>
		<p>To him my guide exclaim&rsquo;d: &ldquo;Perchance thou deem&rsquo;st</p>

		<p>Through those dilapidated crags, that oft</p>

		<p>The foss these go by thousands, aiming shafts</p>
		<p>At whatsoever spirit dares emerge</p>
		<p>From out the blood, more than his guilt allows.</p>
		<p class="slindent">We to those beasts, that rapid strode along,</p>
		<p>Drew near, when Chiron took an arrow forth,</p>
		<p>And with the notch push&rsquo;d back his shaggy beard</p>
		<p>To the cheek-bone, then his great mouth to view</p>
		<p>Exposing, to his fellows thus exclaim&rsquo;d:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Are ye aware, that he who comes behind</p>
		<p>Moves what he touches? The feet of the dead</p>
		<p>Are not so wont.&rdquo; My trusty guide, who now</p>
		<p>Stood near his breast, where the two natures join,</p>
		<p>Thus made reply: &ldquo;He is indeed alive,</p>
		<p>And solitary so must needs by me</p>
		<p>Be shown the gloomy vale, thereto induc&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>By strict necessity, not by delight.</p>
		<p>She left her joyful harpings in the sky,</p>
		<p>Who this new office to my care consign&rsquo;d.</p>
		<p>He is no robber, no dark spirit I.</p>
		<p>But by that virtue, which empowers my step</p>
		<p>To treat so wild a path, grant us, I pray,</p>
		<p>One of thy band, whom we may trust secure,</p>
		<p>Who to the ford may lead us, and convey</p>
		<p>Across, him mounted on his back; for he</p>
		<p>Is not a spirit that may walk the air.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Then on his right breast turning, Chiron thus</p>
		<p>To Nessus spake: &ldquo;Return, and be their guide.</p>
		<p>And if ye chance to cross another troop,</p>
		<p>Command them keep aloof.&rdquo; Onward we mov&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>The faithful escort by our side, along</p>
		<p>The border of the crimson-seething flood,</p>
		<p>Whence from those steep&rsquo;d within loud shrieks arose.</p>
		<p class="slindent">Some there I mark&rsquo;d, as high as to their brow</p>
		<p>Immers&rsquo;d, of whom the mighty Centaur thus:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;These are the souls of tyrants, who were given</p>
		<p>To blood and rapine. Here they wail aloud</p>
		<p>Their merciless wrongs. Here Alexander dwells,</p>
		<p>And Dionysius fell, who many a year</p>
		<p>Of woe wrought for fair Sicily. That brow</p>
		<p>Whereon the hair so jetty clust&rsquo;ring hangs,</p>
		<p>Is Azzolino; that with flaxen locks</p>
		<p>Obizzo&rsquo; of Este, in the world destroy&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>By his foul step-son.&rdquo; To the bard rever&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>I turned me round, and thus he spake; &ldquo;Let him</p>
		<p>Be to thee now first leader, me but next</p>
		<p>To him in rank.&rdquo; Then farther on a space</p>
		<p>The Centaur paus&rsquo;d, near some, who at the throat</p>
		<p>Were extant from the wave; and showing us</p>
		<p>A spirit by itself apart retir&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Exclaim&rsquo;d: &ldquo;He in God&rsquo;s bosom smote the heart,</p>
		<p>Which yet is honour&rsquo;d on the bank of Thames.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">A race I next espied, who held the head,</p>
		<p>And even all the bust above the stream.</p>
		<p>&rsquo;Midst these I many a face remember&rsquo;d well.</p>
		<p>Thus shallow more and more the blood became,</p>
		<p>So that at last it but imbru&rsquo;d the feet;</p>
		<p>And there our passage lay athwart the foss.</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;As ever on this side the boiling wave</p>
		<p>Thou seest diminishing,&rdquo; the Centaur said,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;So on the other, be thou well assur&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>It lower still and lower sinks its bed,</p>
		<p>Till in that part it reuniting join,</p>
		<p>Where &rsquo;t is the lot of tyranny to mourn.</p>
		<p>There Heav&rsquo;n&rsquo;s stern justice lays chastising hand</p>
		<p>On Attila, who was the scourge of earth,</p>
		<p>On Sextus, and on Pyrrhus, and extracts</p>
		<p>Tears ever by the seething flood unlock&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>From the Rinieri, of Corneto this,</p>
		<p>Pazzo the other nam&rsquo;d, who fill&rsquo;d the ways</p>
		<p>With violence and war.&rdquo; This said, he turn&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>And quitting us, alone repass&rsquo;d the ford.</p>

		`<p class="cantohead">Canto XIII</p>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p><span class="sc">Ere</span> Nessus yet had reach&rsquo;d the other bank,</p>
		<p>We enter&rsquo;d on a forest, where no track</p>
		<p>Of steps had worn a way. Not verdant there</p>
		<p>The foliage, but of dusky hue; not light</p>
		<p>The boughs and tapering, but with knares deform&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>And matted thick: fruits there were none, but thorns</p>
		<p>Instead, with venom fill&rsquo;d. Less sharp than these,</p>
		<p>Less intricate the brakes, wherein abide</p>
		<p>Those animals, that hate the cultur&rsquo;d fields,</p>
		<p>Betwixt Corneto and Cecina&rsquo;s stream.</p>
		<p class="slindent">Here the brute Harpies make their nest, the same</p>
		<p>Who from the Strophades the Trojan band</p>
		<p>Drove with dire boding of their future woe.</p>
		<p>Broad are their pennons, of the human form</p>
		<p>Their neck and count&rsquo;nance, arm&rsquo;d with talons keen</p>
		<p>The feet, and the huge belly fledge with wings</p>
		<p>These sit and wail on the drear mystic wood.</p>
		<p class="slindent">The kind instructor in these words began:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Ere farther thou proceed, know thou art now</p>
		<p>I&rsquo; th&rsquo; second round, and shalt be, till thou come</p>
		<p>Upon the horrid sand: look therefore well</p>
		<p>Around thee, and such things thou shalt behold,</p>
		<p>As would my speech discredit.&rdquo; On all sides</p>
		<p>I heard sad plainings breathe, and none could see</p>
		<p>From whom they might have issu&rsquo;d. In amaze</p>
		<p>Fast bound I stood. He, as it seem&rsquo;d, believ&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>That I had thought so many voices came</p>
		<p>From some amid those thickets close conceal&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>And thus his speech resum&rsquo;d: &ldquo;If thou lop off</p>
		<p>A single twig from one of those ill plants,</p>
		<p>The thought thou hast conceiv&rsquo;d shall vanish quite.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Thereat a little stretching forth my hand,</p>
		<p>From a great wilding gather&rsquo;d I a branch,</p>
		<p>And straight the trunk exclaim&rsquo;d: &ldquo;Why pluck&rsquo;st thou me?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Then as the dark blood trickled down its side,</p>
		<p>These words it added: &ldquo;Wherefore tear&rsquo;st me thus?</p>
		<p>Is there no touch of mercy in thy breast?</p>
		<p>Men once were we, that now are rooted here.</p>
		<p>Thy hand might well have spar&rsquo;d us, had we been</p>
		<p>The souls of serpents.&rdquo; As a brand yet green,</p>
		<p>That burning at one end from the&rsquo; other sends</p>
		<p>A groaning sound, and hisses with the wind</p>
		<p>That forces out its way, so burst at once,</p>
		<p>Forth from the broken splinter words and blood.</p>
		<p class="slindent">I, letting fall the bough, remain&rsquo;d as one</p>
		<p>Assail&rsquo;d by terror, and the sage replied:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;If he, O injur&rsquo;d spirit! could have believ&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>What he hath seen but in my verse describ&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>He never against thee had stretch&rsquo;d his hand.</p>
		<p>But I, because the thing surpass&rsquo;d belief,</p>
		<p>Prompted him to this deed, which even now</p>
		<p>Myself I rue. But tell me, who thou wast;</p>
		<p>That, for this wrong to do thee some amends,</p>
		<p>In the upper world (for thither to return</p>
		<p>Is granted him) thy fame he may revive.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;That pleasant word of thine,&rdquo; the trunk replied</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Hath so inveigled me, that I from speech</p>
		<p>Cannot refrain, wherein if I indulge</p>
		<p>A little longer, in the snare detain&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Count it not grievous. I it was, who held</p>
		<p>Both keys to Frederick&rsquo;s heart, and turn&rsquo;d the wards,</p>
		<p>Opening and shutting, with a skill so sweet,</p>
		<p>That besides me, into his inmost breast</p>
		<p>Scarce any other could admittance find.</p>
		<p>The faith I bore to my high charge was such,</p>
		<p>It cost me the life-blood that warm&rsquo;d my veins.</p>
		<p>The harlot, who ne&rsquo;er turn&rsquo;d her gloating eyes</p>
		<p>From Caesar&rsquo;s household, common vice and pest</p>
		<p>Of courts, &rsquo;gainst me inflam&rsquo;d the minds of all;</p>
		<p>And to Augustus they so spread the flame,</p>
		<p>That my glad honours chang&rsquo;d to bitter woes.</p>
		<p>My soul, disdainful and disgusted, sought</p>
		<p>Refuge in death from scorn, and I became,</p>
		<p>Just as I was, unjust toward myself.</p>
		<p>By the new roots, which fix this stem, I swear,</p>
		<p>That never faith I broke to my liege lord,</p>
		<p>Who merited such honour; and of you,</p>
		<p>If any to the world indeed return,</p>
		<p>Clear he from wrong my memory, that lies</p>
		<p>Yet prostrate under envy&rsquo;s cruel blow.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">First somewhat pausing, till the mournful words</p>
		<p>Were ended, then to me the bard began:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Lose not the time; but speak and of him ask,</p>
		<p>If more thou wish to learn.&rdquo; Whence I replied:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Question thou him again of whatsoe&rsquo;er</p>
		<p>Will, as thou think&rsquo;st, content me; for no power</p>
		<p>Have I to ask, such pity&rsquo; is at my heart.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">He thus resum&rsquo;d; &ldquo;So may he do for thee</p>
		<p>Freely what thou entreatest, as thou yet</p>
		<p>Be pleas&rsquo;d, imprison&rsquo;d Spirit! to declare,</p>
		<p>How in these gnarled joints the soul is tied;</p>
		<p>And whether any ever from such frame</p>
		<p>Be loosen&rsquo;d, if thou canst, that also tell.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Thereat the trunk breath&rsquo;d hard, and the wind soon</p>
		<p>Chang&rsquo;d into sounds articulate like these;</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Briefly ye shall be answer&rsquo;d. When departs</p>
		<p>The fierce soul from the body, by itself</p>
		<p>Thence torn asunder, to the seventh gulf</p>
		<p>By Minos doom&rsquo;d, into the wood it falls,</p>
		<p>No place assign&rsquo;d, but wheresoever chance</p>
		<p>Hurls it, there sprouting, as a grain of spelt,</p>
		<p>It rises to a sapling, growing thence</p>
		<p>A savage plant. The Harpies, on its leaves</p>
		<p>Then feeding, cause both pain and for the pain</p>
		<p>A vent to grief. We, as the rest, shall come</p>
		<p>For our own spoils, yet not so that with them</p>
		<p>We may again be clad; for what a man</p>
		<p>Takes from himself it is not just he have.</p>
		<p>Here we perforce shall drag them; and throughout</p>
		<p>The dismal glade our bodies shall be hung,</p>
		<p>Each on the wild thorn of his wretched shade.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Attentive yet to listen to the trunk</p>
		<p>We stood, expecting farther speech, when us</p>
		<p>A noise surpris&rsquo;d, as when a man perceives</p>
		<p>The wild boar and the hunt approach his place</p>
		<p>Of station&rsquo;d watch, who of the beasts and boughs</p>
		<p>Loud rustling round him hears. And lo! there came</p>
		<p>Two naked, torn with briers, in headlong flight,</p>
		<p>That they before them broke each fan o&rsquo; th&rsquo; wood.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Haste now,&rdquo; the foremost cried, &ldquo;now haste thee death!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>The&rsquo; other, as seem&rsquo;d, impatient of delay</p>
		<p>Exclaiming, &ldquo;Lano! not so bent for speed</p>
		<p>Thy sinews, in the lists of Toppo&rsquo;s field.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>And then, for that perchance no longer breath</p>
		<p>Suffic&rsquo;d him, of himself and of a bush</p>
		<p>One group he made. Behind them was the wood</p>
		<p>Full of black female mastiffs, gaunt and fleet,</p>
		<p>As greyhounds that have newly slipp&rsquo;d the leash.</p>
		<p>On him, who squatted down, they stuck their fangs,</p>
		<p>And having rent him piecemeal bore away</p>
		<p>The tortur&rsquo;d limbs. My guide then seiz&rsquo;d my hand,</p>
		<p>And led me to the thicket, which in vain</p>
		<p>Mourn&rsquo;d through its bleeding wounds: &ldquo;O Giacomo</p>
		<p>Of Sant&rsquo; Andrea! what avails it thee,&rdquo;</p>
		<p>It cried, &ldquo;that of me thou hast made thy screen?</p>
		<p>For thy ill life what blame on me recoils?&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">When o&rsquo;er it he had paus&rsquo;d, my master spake:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Say who wast thou, that at so many points</p>
		<p>Breath&rsquo;st out with blood thy lamentable speech?&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">He answer&rsquo;d: &ldquo;Oh, ye spirits: arriv&rsquo;d in time</p>
		<p>To spy the shameful havoc, that from me</p>
		<p>My leaves hath sever&rsquo;d thus, gather them up,</p>
		<p>And at the foot of their sad parent-tree</p>
		<p>Carefully lay them. In that city&rsquo; I dwelt,</p>
		<p>Who for the Baptist her first patron chang&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Whence he for this shall cease not with his art</p>
		<p>To work her woe: and if there still remain&rsquo;d not</p>
		<p>On Arno&rsquo;s passage some faint glimpse of him,</p>
		<p>Those citizens, who rear&rsquo;d once more her walls</p>
		<p>Upon the ashes left by Attila,</p>
		<p>Had labour&rsquo;d without profit of their toil.</p>
		<p>I slung the fatal noose from my own roof.&rdquo;</p>
		</div>`,

		`<p class="cantohead">Canto XIV</p>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p><span class="sc">Soon</span> as the charity of native land</p>
		<p>Wrought in my bosom, I the scatter&rsquo;d leaves</p>
		<p>Collected, and to him restor&rsquo;d, who now</p>
		<p>Was hoarse with utt&rsquo;rance. To the limit thence</p>
		<p>We came, which from the third the second round</p>
		<p>Divides, and where of justice is display&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Contrivance horrible. Things then first seen</p>
		<p>Clearlier to manifest, I tell how next</p>
		<p>A plain we reach&rsquo;d, that from its sterile bed</p>
		<p>Each plant repell&rsquo;d. The mournful wood waves round</p>
		<p>Its garland on all sides, as round the wood</p>
		<p>Spreads the sad foss. There, on the very edge,</p>
		<p>Our steps we stay&rsquo;d. It was an area wide</p>
		<p>Of arid sand and thick, resembling most</p>
		<p>The soil that erst by Cato&rsquo;s foot was trod.</p>
		<p class="slindent">Vengeance of Heav&rsquo;n! Oh! how shouldst thou be fear&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>By all, who read what here my eyes beheld!</p>
		<p class="slindent">Of naked spirits many a flock I saw,</p>
		<p>All weeping piteously, to different laws</p>
		<p>Subjected: for on the&rsquo; earth some lay supine,</p>
		<p>Some crouching close were seated, others pac&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Incessantly around; the latter tribe,</p>
		<p>More numerous, those fewer who beneath</p>
		<p>The torment lay, but louder in their grief.</p>
		<p class="slindent">O&rsquo;er all the sand fell slowly wafting down</p>
		<p>Dilated flakes of fire, as flakes of snow</p>
		<p>On Alpine summit, when the wind is hush&rsquo;d.</p>
		<p>As in the torrid Indian clime, the son</p>
		<p>Of Ammon saw upon his warrior band</p>
		<p>Descending, solid flames, that to the ground</p>
		<p>Came down: whence he bethought him with his troop</p>
		<p>To trample on the soil; for easier thus</p>
		<p>The vapour was extinguish&rsquo;d, while alone;</p>
		<p>So fell the eternal fiery flood, wherewith</p>
		<p>The marble glow&rsquo;d underneath, as under stove</p>
		<p>The viands, doubly to augment the pain.</p>
		<p>Unceasing was the play of wretched hands,</p>
		<p>Now this, now that way glancing, to shake off</p>
		<p>The heat, still falling fresh. I thus began:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Instructor! thou who all things overcom&rsquo;st,</p>
		<p>Except the hardy demons, that rush&rsquo;d forth</p>
		<p>To stop our entrance at the gate, say who</p>
		<p>Is yon huge spirit, that, as seems, heeds not</p>
		<p>The burning, but lies writhen in proud scorn,</p>
		<p>As by the sultry tempest immatur&rsquo;d?&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Straight he himself, who was aware I ask&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>My guide of him, exclaim&rsquo;d: &ldquo;Such as I was</p>
		<p>When living, dead such now I am. If Jove</p>
		<p>Weary his workman out, from whom in ire</p>
		<p>He snatch&rsquo;d the lightnings, that at my last day</p>
		<p>Transfix&rsquo;d me, if the rest be weary out</p>
		<p>At their black smithy labouring by turns</p>
		<p>In Mongibello, while he cries aloud;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Help, help, good Mulciber!&rdquo; as erst he cried</p>
		<p>In the Phlegraean warfare, and the bolts</p>
		<p>Launch he full aim&rsquo;d at me with all his might,</p>
		<p>He never should enjoy a sweet revenge.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Then thus my guide, in accent higher rais&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Than I before had heard him: &ldquo;Capaneus!</p>
		<p>Thou art more punish&rsquo;d, in that this thy pride</p>
		<p>Lives yet unquench&rsquo;d: no torrent, save thy rage,</p>
		<p>Were to thy fury pain proportion&rsquo;d full.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Next turning round to me with milder lip</p>
		<p>He spake: &ldquo;This of the seven kings was one,</p>
		<p>Who girt the Theban walls with siege, and held,</p>
		<p>As still he seems to hold, God in disdain,</p>
		<p>And sets his high omnipotence at nought.</p>
		<p>But, as I told him, his despiteful mood</p>
		<p>Is ornament well suits the breast that wears it.</p>
		<p>Follow me now; and look thou set not yet</p>
		<p>Thy foot in the hot sand, but to the wood</p>
		<p>Keep ever close.&rdquo; Silently on we pass&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>To where there gushes from the forest&rsquo;s bound</p>
		<p>A little brook, whose crimson&rsquo;d wave yet lifts</p>
		<p>My hair with horror. As the rill, that runs</p>
		<p>From Bulicame, to be portion&rsquo;d out</p>
		<p>Among the sinful women; so ran this</p>
		<p>Down through the sand, its bottom and each bank</p>
		<p>Stone-built, and either margin at its side,</p>
		<p>Whereon I straight perceiv&rsquo;d our passage lay.</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Of all that I have shown thee, since that gate</p>
		<p>We enter&rsquo;d first, whose threshold is to none</p>
		<p>Denied, nought else so worthy of regard,</p>
		<p>As is this river, has thine eye discern&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>O&rsquo;er which the flaming volley all is quench&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">So spake my guide; and I him thence besought,</p>
		<p>That having giv&rsquo;n me appetite to know,</p>
		<p>The food he too would give, that hunger crav&rsquo;d.</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;In midst of ocean,&rdquo; forthwith he began,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;A desolate country lies, which Crete is nam&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Under whose monarch in old times the world</p>
		<p>Liv&rsquo;d pure and chaste. A mountain rises there,</p>
		<p>Call&rsquo;d Ida, joyous once with leaves and streams,</p>
		<p>Deserted now like a forbidden thing.</p>
		<p>It was the spot which Rhea, Saturn&rsquo;s spouse,</p>
		<p>Chose for the secret cradle of her son;</p>
		<p>And better to conceal him, drown&rsquo;d in shouts</p>
		<p>His infant cries. Within the mount, upright</p>
		<p>An ancient form there stands and huge, that turns</p>
		<p>His shoulders towards Damiata, and at Rome</p>
		<p>As in his mirror looks. Of finest gold</p>
		<p>His head is shap&rsquo;d, pure silver are the breast</p>
		<p>And arms; thence to the middle is of brass.</p>
		<p>And downward all beneath well-temper&rsquo;d steel,</p>
		<p>Save the right foot of potter&rsquo;s clay, on which</p>
		<p>Than on the other more erect he stands,</p>
		<p>Each part except the gold, is rent throughout;</p>
		<p>And from the fissure tears distil, which join&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Penetrate to that cave. They in their course</p>
		<p>Thus far precipitated down the rock</p>
		<p>Form Acheron, and Styx, and Phlegethon;</p>
		<p>Then by this straiten&rsquo;d channel passing hence</p>
		<p>Beneath, e&rsquo;en to the lowest depth of all,</p>
		<p>Form there Cocytus, of whose lake (thyself</p>
		<p>Shall see it) I here give thee no account.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Then I to him: &ldquo;If from our world this sluice</p>
		<p>Be thus deriv&rsquo;d; wherefore to us but now</p>
		<p>Appears it at this edge?&rdquo; He straight replied:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;The place, thou know&rsquo;st, is round; and though great part</p>
		<p>Thou have already pass&rsquo;d, still to the left</p>
		<p>Descending to the nethermost, not yet</p>
		<p>Hast thou the circuit made of the whole orb.</p>
		<p>Wherefore if aught of new to us appear,</p>
		<p>It needs not bring up wonder in thy looks.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Then I again inquir&rsquo;d: &ldquo;Where flow the streams</p>
		<p>Of Phlegethon and Lethe? for of one</p>
		<p>Thou tell&rsquo;st not, and the other of that shower,</p>
		<p>Thou say&rsquo;st, is form&rsquo;d.&rdquo; He answer thus return&rsquo;d:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Doubtless thy questions all well pleas&rsquo;d I hear.</p>
		<p>Yet the red seething wave might have resolv&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>One thou proposest. Lethe thou shalt see,</p>
		<p>But not within this hollow, in the place,</p>
		<p>Whither to lave themselves the spirits go,</p>
		<p>Whose blame hath been by penitence remov&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>He added: &ldquo;Time is now we quit the wood.</p>
		<p>Look thou my steps pursue: the margins give</p>
		<p>Safe passage, unimpeded by the flames;</p>
		<p>For over them all vapour is extinct.&rdquo;</p>

		<p class="slindent">Thus narrowly explor&rsquo;d by all the tribe,</p>
		<p>I was agniz&rsquo;d of one, who by the skirt</p>
		<p>Caught me, and cried, &ldquo;What wonder have we here!&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">And I, when he to me outstretch&rsquo;d his arm,</p>
		<p>Intently fix&rsquo;d my ken on his parch&rsquo;d looks,</p>
		<p>That although smirch&rsquo;d with fire, they hinder&rsquo;d not</p>
		<p>But I remember&rsquo;d him; and towards his face</p>
		<p>My hand inclining, answer&rsquo;d: &ldquo;Sir! Brunetto!</p>
		<p>&ldquo;And art thou here?&rdquo; He thus to me: &ldquo;My son!</p>
		<p>Oh let it not displease thee, if Brunetto</p>
		<p>Latini but a little space with thee</p>
		<p>Turn back, and leave his fellows to proceed.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">I thus to him replied: &ldquo;Much as I can,</p>
		<p>I thereto pray thee; and if thou be willing,</p>
		<p>That I here seat me with thee, I consent;</p>
		<p>His leave, with whom I journey, first obtain&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;O son!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;whoever of this throng</p>
		<p>One instant stops, lies then a hundred years,</p>
		<p>No fan to ventilate him, when the fire</p>
		<p>Smites sorest. Pass thou therefore on. I close</p>
		<p>Will at thy garments walk, and then rejoin</p>
		<p>My troop, who go mourning their endless doom.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">I dar&rsquo;d not from the path descend to tread</p>
		<p>On equal ground with him, but held my head</p>
		<p>Bent down, as one who walks in reverent guise.</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;What chance or destiny,&rdquo; thus he began,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Ere the last day conducts thee here below?</p>
		<p>And who is this, that shows to thee the way?&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;There up aloft,&rdquo; I answer&rsquo;d, &ldquo;in the life</p>
		<p>Serene, I wander&rsquo;d in a valley lost,</p>
		<p>Before mine age had to its fullness reach&rsquo;d.</p>
		<p>But yester-morn I left it: then once more</p>
		<p>Into that vale returning, him I met;</p>
		<p>And by this path homeward he leads me back.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;If thou,&rdquo; he answer&rsquo;d, &ldquo;follow but thy star,</p>
		<p>Thou canst not miss at last a glorious haven:</p>
		<p>Unless in fairer days my judgment err&rsquo;d.</p>
		<p>And if my fate so early had not chanc&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Seeing the heav&rsquo;ns thus bounteous to thee, I</p>
		<p>Had gladly giv&rsquo;n thee comfort in thy work.</p>
		<p>But that ungrateful and malignant race,</p>
		<p>Who in old times came down from Fesole,</p>
		<p>Ay and still smack of their rough mountain-flint,</p>
		<p>Will for thy good deeds shew thee enmity.</p>
		<p>Nor wonder; for amongst ill-savour&rsquo;d crabs</p>
		<p>It suits not the sweet fig-tree lay her fruit.</p>
		<p>Old fame reports them in the world for blind,</p>
		<p>Covetous, envious, proud. Look to it well:</p>
		<p>Take heed thou cleanse thee of their ways. For thee</p>
		<p>Thy fortune hath such honour in reserve,</p>
		<p>That thou by either party shalt be crav&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>With hunger keen: but be the fresh herb far</p>
		<p>From the goat&rsquo;s tooth. The herd of Fesole</p>
		<p>May of themselves make litter, not touch the plant,</p>
		<p>If any such yet spring on their rank bed,</p>
		<p>In which the holy seed revives, transmitted</p>
		<p>From those true Romans, who still there remain&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>When it was made the nest of so much ill.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Were all my wish fulfill&rsquo;d,&rdquo; I straight replied,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Thou from the confines of man&rsquo;s nature yet</p>
		<p>Hadst not been driven forth; for in my mind</p>
		<p>Is fix&rsquo;d, and now strikes full upon my heart</p>
		<p>The dear, benign, paternal image, such</p>
		<p>As thine was, when so lately thou didst teach me</p>
		<p>The way for man to win eternity;</p>
		<p>And how I priz&rsquo;d the lesson, it behooves,</p>
		<p>That, long as life endures, my tongue should speak,</p>
		<p>What of my fate thou tell&rsquo;st, that write I down:</p>
		<p>And with another text to comment on</p>
		<p>For her I keep it, the celestial dame,</p>
		<p>Who will know all, if I to her arrive.</p>
		<p>This only would I have thee clearly note:</p>
		<p>That so my conscience have no plea against me;</p>
		<p>Do fortune as she list, I stand prepar&rsquo;d.</p>
		<p>Not new or strange such earnest to mine ear.</p>
		<p>Speed fortune then her wheel, as likes her best,</p>
		<p>The clown his mattock; all things have their course.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Thereat my sapient guide upon his right</p>
		<p>Turn&rsquo;d himself back, then look&rsquo;d at me and spake:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;He listens to good purpose who takes note.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">I not the less still on my way proceed,</p>
		<p>Discoursing with Brunetto, and inquire</p>
		<p>Who are most known and chief among his tribe.</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;To know of some is well;&rdquo; thus he replied,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;But of the rest silence may best beseem.</p>
		<p>Time would not serve us for report so long.</p>
		<p>In brief I tell thee, that all these were clerks,</p>
		<p>Men of great learning and no less renown,</p>
		<p>By one same sin polluted in the world.</p>
		<p>With them is Priscian, and Accorso&rsquo;s son</p>
		<p>Francesco herds among that wretched throng:</p>
		<p>And, if the wish of so impure a blotch</p>
		<p>Possess&rsquo;d thee, him thou also might&rsquo;st have seen,</p>
		<p>Who by the servants&rsquo; servant was transferr&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>From Arno&rsquo;s seat to Bacchiglione, where</p>
		<p>His ill-strain&rsquo;d nerves he left. I more would add,</p>
		<p>But must from farther speech and onward way</p>
		<p>Alike desist, for yonder I behold</p>
		<p>A mist new-risen on the sandy plain.</p>
		<p>A company, with whom I may not sort,</p>
		<p>Approaches. I commend my TREASURE to thee,</p>
		<p>Wherein I yet survive; my sole request.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">This said he turn&rsquo;d, and seem&rsquo;d as one of those,</p>
		<p>Who o&rsquo;er Verona&rsquo;s champain try their speed</p>
		<p>For the green mantle, and of them he seem&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Not he who loses but who gains the prize.</p>

		<p><span class="sc">Now</span> came I where the water&rsquo;s din was heard,</p>
		<p>As down it fell into the other round,</p>
		<p>Resounding like the hum of swarming bees:</p>
		<p>When forth together issu&rsquo;d from a troop,</p>
		<p>That pass&rsquo;d beneath the fierce tormenting storm,</p>
		<p>Three spirits, running swift. They towards us came,</p>
		<p>And each one cried aloud, &ldquo;Oh do thou stay!</p>
		<p>Whom by the fashion of thy garb we deem</p>
		<p>To be some inmate of our evil land.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Ah me! what wounds I mark&rsquo;d upon their limbs,</p>
		<p>Recent and old, inflicted by the flames!</p>
		<p>E&rsquo;en the remembrance of them grieves me yet.</p>
		<p class="slindent">Attentive to their cry my teacher paus&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>And turn&rsquo;d to me his visage, and then spake;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Wait now! our courtesy these merit well:</p>

		<p>And soon as they had reach&rsquo;d us, all the three</p>
		<p>Whirl&rsquo;d round together in one restless wheel.</p>
		<p>As naked champions, smear&rsquo;d with slippery oil,</p>
		<p>Are wont intent to watch their place of hold</p>
		<p>And vantage, ere in closer strife they meet;</p>
		<p>Thus each one, as he wheel&rsquo;d, his countenance</p>
		<p>At me directed, so that opposite</p>
		<p>The neck mov&rsquo;d ever to the twinkling feet.</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;If misery of this drear wilderness,&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Thus one began, &ldquo;added to our sad cheer</p>
		<p>And destitute, do call forth scorn on us</p>
		<p>And our entreaties, let our great renown</p>
		<p>Incline thee to inform us who thou art,</p>
		<p>That dost imprint with living feet unharm&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>The soil of Hell. He, in whose track thou see&rsquo;st</p>
		<p>My steps pursuing, naked though he be</p>
		<p>And reft of all, was of more high estate</p>
		<p>Than thou believest; grandchild of the chaste</p>
		<p>Gualdrada, him they Guidoguerra call&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Who in his lifetime many a noble act</p>
		<p>Achiev&rsquo;d, both by his wisdom and his sword.</p>
		<p>The other, next to me that beats the sand,</p>
		<p>Is Aldobrandi, name deserving well,</p>
		<p>In the&rsquo; upper world, of honour; and myself</p>
		<p>Who in this torment do partake with them,</p>
		<p>Am Rusticucci, whom, past doubt, my wife</p>
		<p>Of savage temper, more than aught beside</p>
		<p>Hath to this evil brought.&rdquo; If from the fire</p>

		<p>Would have restrain&rsquo;d my going; but that fear</p>
		<p>Of the dire burning vanquish&rsquo;d the desire,</p>
		<p>Which made me eager of their wish&rsquo;d embrace.</p>
		<p class="slindent">I then began: &ldquo;Not scorn, but grief much more,</p>
		<p>Such as long time alone can cure, your doom</p>
		<p>Fix&rsquo;d deep within me, soon as this my lord</p>

		<p>I am a countryman of yours, who still</p>

		<p>Your deeds and names renown&rsquo;d. Leaving the gall</p>
		<p>For the sweet fruit I go, that a sure guide</p>
		<p>Hath promis&rsquo;d to me. But behooves, that far</p>
		<p>As to the centre first I downward tend.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;So may long space thy spirit guide thy limbs,&rdquo;</p>
		<p>He answer straight return&rsquo;d; &ldquo;and so thy fame</p>
		<p>Shine bright, when thou art gone; as thou shalt tell,</p>
		<p>If courtesy and valour, as they wont,</p>
		<p>Dwell in our city, or have vanish&rsquo;d clean?</p>
		<p>For one amidst us late condemn&rsquo;d to wail,</p>
		<p>Borsiere, yonder walking with his peers,</p>
		<p>Grieves us no little by the news he brings.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;An upstart multitude and sudden gains,</p>
		<p>Pride and excess, O Florence! have in thee</p>
		<p>Engender&rsquo;d, so that now in tears thou mourn&rsquo;st!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Thus cried I with my face uprais&rsquo;d, and they</p>
		<p>All three, who for an answer took my words,</p>
		<p>Look&rsquo;d at each other, as men look when truth</p>
		<p>Comes to their ear. &ldquo;If thou at other times,&rdquo;</p>
		<p>They all at once rejoin&rsquo;d, &ldquo;so easily</p>
		<p>Satisfy those, who question, happy thou,</p>
		<p>Gifted with words, so apt to speak thy thought!</p>
		<p>Wherefore if thou escape this darksome clime,</p>
		<p>Returning to behold the radiant stars,</p>
		<p>When thou with pleasure shalt retrace the past,</p>
		<p>See that of us thou speak among mankind.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">This said, they broke the circle, and so swift</p>
		<p>Fled, that as pinions seem&rsquo;d their nimble feet.</p>
		<p class="slindent">Not in so short a time might one have said</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; as they had vanish&rsquo;d. Straight my guide</p>
		<p>Pursu&rsquo;d his track. I follow&rsquo;d; and small space</p>
		<p>Had we pass&rsquo;d onward, when the water&rsquo;s sound</p>
		<p>Was now so near at hand, that we had scarce</p>
		<p>Heard one another&rsquo;s speech for the loud din.</p>
		<p class="slindent">E&rsquo;en as the river, that holds on its course</p>
		<p>Unmingled, from the mount of Vesulo,</p>
		<p>On the left side of Apennine, toward</p>
		<p>The east, which Acquacheta higher up</p>
		<p>They call, ere it descend into the vale,</p>
		<p>At Forli by that name no longer known,</p>
		<p>Rebellows o&rsquo;er Saint Benedict, roll&rsquo;d on</p>
		<p>From the&rsquo; Alpine summit down a precipice,</p>
		<p>Where space enough to lodge a thousand spreads;</p>
		<p>Thus downward from a craggy steep we found,</p>
		<p>That this dark wave resounded, roaring loud,</p>
		<p>So that the ear its clamour soon had stunn&rsquo;d.</p>
		<p class="slindent">I had a cord that brac&rsquo;d my girdle round,</p>

		<p>I gather&rsquo;d up, and stretch&rsquo;d it forth to him.</p>
		<p>Then to the right he turn&rsquo;d, and from the brink</p>
		<p>Standing few paces distant, cast it down</p>
		<p>Into the deep abyss. &ldquo;And somewhat strange,&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Thus to myself I spake, &ldquo;signal so strange</p>

		<p>With those who look not at the deed alone,</p>

		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Quickly shall come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what I expect,</p>

		<p>As one returns, who hath been down to loose</p>

		<p>&ldquo;<span class="sc">Lo</span>! the fell monster with the deadly sting!</p>
		<p>Who passes mountains, breaks through fenced walls</p>
		<p>And firm embattled spears, and with his filth</p>
		<p>Taints all the world!&rdquo; Thus me my guide address&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>And beckon&rsquo;d him, that he should come to shore,</p>
		<p>Near to the stony causeway&rsquo;s utmost edge.</p>
		<p class="slindent">Forthwith that image vile of fraud appear&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>His head and upper part expos&rsquo;d on land,</p>
		<p>But laid not on the shore his bestial train.</p>
		<p>His face the semblance of a just man&rsquo;s wore,</p>
		<p>So kind and gracious was its outward cheer;</p>
		<p>The rest was serpent all: two shaggy claws</p>
		<p>Reach&rsquo;d to the armpits, and the back and breast,</p>
		<p>And either side, were painted o&rsquo;er with nodes</p>
		<p>And orbits. Colours variegated more</p>
		<p>Nor Turks nor Tartars e&rsquo;er on cloth of state</p>
		<p>With interchangeable embroidery wove,</p>
		<p>Nor spread Arachne o&rsquo;er her curious loom.</p>
		<p>As ofttimes a light skiff, moor&rsquo;d to the shore,</p>
		<p>Stands part in water, part upon the land;</p>
		<p>Or, as where dwells the greedy German boor,</p>
		<p>The beaver settles watching for his prey;</p>
		<p>So on the rim, that fenc&rsquo;d the sand with rock,</p>
		<p>Sat perch&rsquo;d the fiend of evil. In the void</p>
		<p>Glancing, his tail upturn&rsquo;d its venomous fork,</p>
		<p>With sting like scorpion&rsquo;s arm&rsquo;d. Then thus my guide:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Now need our way must turn few steps apart,</p>
		<p>Far as to that ill beast, who couches there.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Thereat toward the right our downward course</p>
		<p>We shap&rsquo;d, and, better to escape the flame</p>
		<p>And burning marle, ten paces on the verge</p>
		<p>Proceeded. Soon as we to him arrive,</p>
		<p>A little further on mine eye beholds</p>
		<p>A tribe of spirits, seated on the sand</p>
		<p>Near the wide chasm. Forthwith my master spake:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;That to the full thy knowledge may extend</p>
		<p>Of all this round contains, go now, and mark</p>
		<p>The mien these wear: but hold not long discourse.</p>
		<p>Till thou returnest, I with him meantime</p>
		<p>Will parley, that to us he may vouchsafe</p>
		<p>The aid of his strong shoulders.&rdquo; Thus alone</p>
		<p>Yet forward on the&rsquo; extremity I pac&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Of that seventh circle, where the mournful tribe</p>
		<p>Were seated. At the eyes forth gush&rsquo;d their pangs.</p>
		<p>Against the vapours and the torrid soil</p>
		<p>Alternately their shifting hands they plied.</p>
		<p>Thus use the dogs in summer still to ply</p>
		<p>Their jaws and feet by turns, when bitten sore</p>
		<p>By gnats, or flies, or gadflies swarming round.</p>
		<p class="slindent">Noting the visages of some, who lay</p>
		<p>Beneath the pelting of that dolorous fire,</p>
		<p>One of them all I knew not; but perceiv&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>That pendent from his neck each bore a pouch</p>
		<p>With colours and with emblems various mark&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>On which it seem&rsquo;d as if their eye did feed.</p>
		<p class="slindent">And when amongst them looking round I came,</p>
		<p>A yellow purse I saw with azure wrought,</p>
		<p>That wore a lion&rsquo;s countenance and port.</p>
		<p>Then still my sight pursuing its career,</p>
		<p>Another I beheld, than blood more red.</p>
		<p>A goose display of whiter wing than curd.</p>
		<p>And one, who bore a fat and azure swine</p>
		<p>Pictur&rsquo;d on his white scrip, addressed me thus:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;What dost thou in this deep? Go now and know,</p>
		<p>Since yet thou livest, that my neighbour here</p>
		<p>Vitaliano on my left shall sit.</p>
		<p>A Paduan with these Florentines am I.</p>
		<p>Ofttimes they thunder in mine ears, exclaiming</p>
		<p>&rsquo;O haste that noble knight! he who the pouch</p>
		<p>With the three beaks will bring!&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; This said, he writh&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>The mouth, and loll&rsquo;d the tongue out, like an ox</p>
		<p>That licks his nostrils. I, lest longer stay</p>
		<p>He ill might brook, who bade me stay not long,</p>
		<p>Backward my steps from those sad spirits turn&rsquo;d.</p>
		<p class="slindent">My guide already seated on the haunch</p>
		<p>Of the fierce animal I found; and thus</p>
		<p>He me encourag&rsquo;d. &ldquo;Be thou stout; be bold.</p>
		<p>Down such a steep flight must we now descend!</p>
		<p>Mount thou before: for that no power the tail</p>
		<p>May have to harm thee, I will be i&rsquo; th&rsquo; midst.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">As one, who hath an ague fit so near,</p>
		<p>His nails already are turn&rsquo;d blue, and he</p>
		<p>Quivers all o&rsquo;er, if he but eye the shade;</p>
		<p>Such was my cheer at hearing of his words.</p>
		<p>But shame soon interpos&rsquo;d her threat, who makes</p>
		<p>The servant bold in presence of his lord.</p>
		<p class="slindent">I settled me upon those shoulders huge,</p>
		<p>And would have said, but that the words to aid</p>
		<p>My purpose came not, &ldquo;Look thou clasp me firm!&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">But he whose succour then not first I prov&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Soon as I mounted, in his arms aloft,</p>
		<p>Embracing, held me up, and thus he spake:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Geryon! now move thee! be thy wheeling gyres</p>
		<p>Of ample circuit, easy thy descent.</p>
		<p>Think on th&rsquo; unusual burden thou sustain&rsquo;st.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">As a small vessel, back&rsquo;ning out from land,</p>
		<p>Her station quits; so thence the monster loos&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>And when he felt himself at large, turn&rsquo;d round</p>
		<p>There where the breast had been, his forked tail.</p>
		<p>Thus, like an eel, outstretch&rsquo;d at length he steer&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Gath&rsquo;ring the air up with retractile claws.</p>
		<p class="slindent">Not greater was the dread when Phaeton</p>
		<p>The reins let drop at random, whence high heaven,</p>
		<p>Whereof signs yet appear, was wrapt in flames;</p>
		<p>Nor when ill-fated Icarus perceiv&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>By liquefaction of the scalded wax,</p>
		<p>The trusted pennons loosen&rsquo;d from his loins,</p>
		<p>His sire exclaiming loud, &ldquo;Ill way thou keep&rsquo;st!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Than was my dread, when round me on each part</p>
		<p>The air I view&rsquo;d, and other object none</p>
		<p>Save the fell beast. He slowly sailing, wheels</p>
		<p>His downward motion, unobserv&rsquo;d of me,</p>
		<p>But that the wind, arising to my face,</p>
		<p>Breathes on me from below. Now on our right</p>
		<p>I heard the cataract beneath us leap</p>
		<p>With hideous crash; whence bending down to&rsquo; explore,</p>
		<p>New terror I conceiv&rsquo;d at the steep plunge:</p>
		<p>For flames I saw, and wailings smote mine ear:</p>
		<p>So that all trembling close I crouch&rsquo;d my limbs,</p>
		<p>And then distinguish&rsquo;d, unperceiv&rsquo;d before,</p>
		<p>By the dread torments that on every side</p>
		<p>Drew nearer, how our downward course we wound.</p>
		<p class="slindent">As falcon, that hath long been on the wing,</p>
		<p>But lure nor bird hath seen, while in despair</p>
		<p>The falconer cries, &ldquo;Ah me! thou stoop&rsquo;st to earth!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Wearied descends, and swiftly down the sky</p>
		<p>In many an orbit wheels, then lighting sits</p>
		<p>At distance from his lord in angry mood;</p>
		<p>So Geryon lighting places us on foot</p>
		<p>Low down at base of the deep-furrow&rsquo;d rock,</p>
		<p>And, of his burden there discharg&rsquo;d, forthwith</p>

		<p>Affording to the space within, so here</p>
		<p>Were model&rsquo;d these; and as like fortresses</p>
		<p>E&rsquo;en from their threshold to the brink without,</p>
		<p>Are flank&rsquo;d with bridges; from the rock&rsquo;s low base</p>
		<p>Thus flinty paths advanc&rsquo;d, that &rsquo;cross the moles</p>
		<p>And dikes, struck onward far as to the gulf,</p>
		<p>That in one bound collected cuts them off.</p>
		<p>Such was the place, wherein we found ourselves</p>
		<p>From Geryon&rsquo;s back dislodg&rsquo;d. The bard to left</p>
		<p>Held on his way, and I behind him mov&rsquo;d.</p>
		<p class="slindent">On our right hand new misery I saw,</p>
		<p>New pains, new executioners of wrath,</p>
		<p>That swarming peopled the first chasm. Below</p>
		<p>Were naked sinners. Hitherward they came,</p>
		<p>Meeting our faces from the middle point,</p>
		<p>With us beyond but with a larger stride.</p>
		<p>E&rsquo;en thus the Romans, when the year returns</p>
		<p>Of Jubilee, with better speed to rid</p>
		<p>The thronging multitudes, their means devise</p>
		<p>For such as pass the bridge; that on one side</p>
		<p>All front toward the castle, and approach</p>
		<p>Saint Peter&rsquo;s fane, on th&rsquo; other towards the mount.</p>
		<p class="slindent">Each divers way along the grisly rock,</p>
		<p>Horn&rsquo;d demons I beheld, with lashes huge,</p>
		<p>That on their back unmercifully smote.</p>
		<p>Ah! how they made them bound at the first stripe!</p>
		<p>None for the second waited nor the third.</p>
		<p class="slindent">Meantime as on I pass&rsquo;d, one met my sight</p>
		<p>Whom soon as view&rsquo;d; &ldquo;Of him,&rdquo; cried I, &ldquo;not yet</p>
		<p>Mine eye hath had his fill.&rdquo; With fixed gaze</p>
		<p>I therefore scann&rsquo;d him. Straight the teacher kind</p>
		<p>Paus&rsquo;d with me, and consented I should walk</p>
		<p>Backward a space, and the tormented spirit,</p>
		<p>Who thought to hide him, bent his visage down.</p>
		<p>But it avail&rsquo;d him nought; for I exclaim&rsquo;d:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Thou who dost cast thy eye upon the ground,</p>
		<p>Unless thy features do belie thee much,</p>
		<p>Venedico art thou. But what brings thee</p>
		<p>Into this bitter seas&rsquo;ning?&rdquo; He replied:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Unwillingly I answer to thy words.</p>
		<p>But thy clear speech, that to my mind recalls</p>
		<p>The world I once inhabited, constrains me.</p>
		<p>Know then &rsquo;twas I who led fair Ghisola</p>
		<p>To do the Marquis&rsquo; will, however fame</p>
		<p>The shameful tale have bruited. Nor alone</p>
		<p>Bologna hither sendeth me to mourn</p>
		<p>Rather with us the place is so o&rsquo;erthrong&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>That not so many tongues this day are taught,</p>
		<p>Betwixt the Reno and Savena&rsquo;s stream,</p>
		<p>To answer SIPA in their country&rsquo;s phrase.</p>
		<p>And if of that securer proof thou need,</p>
		<p>Remember but our craving thirst for gold.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Him speaking thus, a demon with his thong</p>
		<p>Struck, and exclaim&rsquo;d, &ldquo;Away! corrupter! here</p>
		<p>Women are none for sale.&rdquo; Forthwith I join&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>My escort, and few paces thence we came</p>
		<p>To where a rock forth issued from the bank.</p>
		<p>That easily ascended, to the right</p>
		<p>Upon its splinter turning, we depart</p>
		<p>From those eternal barriers. When arriv&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Where underneath the gaping arch lets pass</p>
		<p>The scourged souls: &ldquo;Pause here,&rdquo; the teacher said,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;And let these others miserable, now</p>
		<p>Strike on thy ken, faces not yet beheld,</p>
		<p>For that together they with us have walk&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">From the old bridge we ey&rsquo;d the pack, who came</p>
		<p>From th&rsquo; other side towards us, like the rest,</p>
		<p>Excoriate from the lash. My gentle guide,</p>
		<p>By me unquestion&rsquo;d, thus his speech resum&rsquo;d:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Behold that lofty shade, who this way tends,</p>
		<p>And seems too woe-begone to drop a tear.</p>
		<p>How yet the regal aspect he retains!</p>
		<p>Jason is he, whose skill and prowess won</p>
		<p>The ram from Colchos. To the Lemnian isle</p>
		<p>His passage thither led him, when those bold</p>
		<p>And pitiless women had slain all their males.</p>
		<p>There he with tokens and fair witching words</p>
		<p>Hypsipyle beguil&rsquo;d, a virgin young,</p>
		<p>Who first had all the rest herself beguil&rsquo;d.</p>
		<p>Impregnated he left her there forlorn.</p>
		<p>Such is the guilt condemns him to this pain.</p>
		<p>Here too Medea&rsquo;s inj&rsquo;ries are avenged.</p>
		<p>All bear him company, who like deceit</p>
		<p>To his have practis&rsquo;d. And thus much to know</p>
		<p>Of the first vale suffice thee, and of those</p>
		<p>Whom its keen torments urge.&rdquo; Now had we come</p>
		<p>Where, crossing the next pier, the straighten&rsquo;d path</p>
		<p>Bestrides its shoulders to another arch.</p>
		<p class="slindent">Hence in the second chasm we heard the ghosts,</p>
		<p>Who jibber in low melancholy sounds,</p>
		<p>With wide-stretch&rsquo;d nostrils snort, and on themselves</p>
		<p>Smite with their palms. Upon the banks a scurf</p>
		<p>From the foul steam condens&rsquo;d, encrusting hung,</p>
		<p>That held sharp combat with the sight and smell.</p>
		<p class="slindent">So hollow is the depth, that from no part,</p>
		<p>Save on the summit of the rocky span,</p>
		<p>Could I distinguish aught. Thus far we came;</p>
		<p>And thence I saw, within the foss below,</p>
		<p>A crowd immers&rsquo;d in ordure, that appear&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Draff of the human body. There beneath</p>
		<p>Searching with eye inquisitive, I mark&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>One with his head so grim&rsquo;d, &rsquo;t were hard to deem,</p>
		<p>If he were clerk or layman. Loud he cried:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Why greedily thus bendest more on me,</p>
		<p>Than on these other filthy ones, thy ken?&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Because if true my mem&rsquo;ry,&rdquo; I replied,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I heretofore have seen thee with dry locks,</p>
		<p>And thou Alessio art of Lucca sprung.</p>
		<p>Therefore than all the rest I scan thee more.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Then beating on his brain these words he spake:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Me thus low down my flatteries have sunk,</p>
		<p>Wherewith I ne&rsquo;er enough could glut my tongue.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">My leader thus: &ldquo;A little further stretch</p>
		<p>Thy face, that thou the visage well mayst note</p>
		<p>Of that besotted, sluttish courtezan,</p>
		<p>Who there doth rend her with defiled nails,</p>
		<p>Now crouching down, now risen on her feet.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Thais is this, the harlot, whose false lip</p>
		<p>Answer&rsquo;d her doting paramour that ask&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>&lsquo;Thankest me much!&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;say rather wondrously,&rsquo;</p>

		<p>For gold and silver in adultery!</p>
		<p>Now must the trumpet sound for you, since yours</p>
		<p>Is the third chasm. Upon the following vault</p>
		<p>We now had mounted, where the rock impends</p>
		<p>Directly o&rsquo;er the centre of the foss.</p>
		<p class="slindent">Wisdom Supreme! how wonderful the art,</p>
		<p>Which thou dost manifest in heaven, in earth,</p>
		<p>And in the evil world, how just a meed</p>
		<p>Allotting by thy virtue unto all!</p>
		<p class="slindent">I saw the livid stone, throughout the sides</p>
		<p>And in its bottom full of apertures,</p>
		<p>All equal in their width, and circular each,</p>

		<p>Than in Saint John&rsquo;s fair dome of me belov&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Those fram&rsquo;d to hold the pure baptismal streams,</p>
		<p>One of the which I brake, some few years past,</p>
		<p>To save a whelming infant; and be this</p>
		<p>A seal to undeceive whoever doubts</p>
		<p>The motive of my deed. From out the mouth</p>
		<p>Of every one, emerg&rsquo;d a sinner&rsquo;s feet</p>
		<p>And of the legs high upward as the calf</p>
		<p>The rest beneath was hid. On either foot</p>
		<p>The soles were burning, whence the flexile joints</p>
		<p>Glanc&rsquo;d with such violent motion, as had snapt</p>
		<p>Asunder cords or twisted withs. As flame,</p>
		<p>Feeding on unctuous matter, glides along</p>
		<p>The surface, scarcely touching where it moves;</p>
		<p>So here, from heel to point, glided the flames.</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Master! say who is he, than all the rest</p>
		<p>Glancing in fiercer agony, on whom</p>
		<p>A ruddier flame doth prey?&rdquo; I thus inquir&rsquo;d.</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;If thou be willing,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;that I</p>
		<p>Carry thee down, where least the slope bank falls,</p>
		<p>He of himself shall tell thee and his wrongs.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">I then: &ldquo;As pleases thee to me is best.</p>
		<p>Thou art my lord; and know&rsquo;st that ne&rsquo;er I quit</p>
		<p>Thy will: what silence hides that knowest thou.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Thereat on the fourth pier we came, we turn&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>And on our left descended to the depth,</p>
		<p>A narrow strait and perforated close.</p>
		<p>Nor from his side my leader set me down,</p>
		<p>Till to his orifice he brought, whose limb</p>
		<p>Quiv&rsquo;ring express&rsquo;d his pang. &ldquo;Whoe&rsquo;er thou art,</p>
		<p>Sad spirit! thus revers&rsquo;d, and as a stake</p>
		<p>Driv&rsquo;n in the soil!&rdquo; I in these words began,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;If thou be able, utter forth thy voice.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">There stood I like the friar, that doth shrive</p>
		<p>A wretch for murder doom&rsquo;d, who e&rsquo;en when fix&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Calleth him back, whence death awhile delays.</p>
		<p class="slindent">He shouted: &ldquo;Ha! already standest there?</p>
		<p>Already standest there, O Boniface!</p>
		<p>By many a year the writing play&rsquo;d me false.</p>
		<p>So early dost thou surfeit with the wealth,</p>
		<p>For which thou fearedst not in guile to take</p>
		<p>The lovely lady, and then mangle her?&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">I felt as those who, piercing not the drift</p>
		<p>Of answer made them, stand as if expos&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>In mockery, nor know what to reply,</p>
		<p>When Virgil thus admonish&rsquo;d: &ldquo;Tell him quick,</p>
		<p>I am not he, not he, whom thou believ&rsquo;st.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">And I, as was enjoin&rsquo;d me, straight replied.</p>
		<p class="slindent">That heard, the spirit all did wrench his feet,</p>
		<p>And sighing next in woeful accent spake:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;What then of me requirest? If to know</p>
		<p>So much imports thee, who I am, that thou</p>
		<p>Hast therefore down the bank descended, learn</p>
		<p>That in the mighty mantle I was rob&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>And of a she-bear was indeed the son,</p>
		<p>So eager to advance my whelps, that there</p>
		<p>My having in my purse above I stow&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>And here myself. Under my head are dragg&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>The rest, my predecessors in the guilt</p>
		<p>Of simony. Stretch&rsquo;d at their length they lie</p>
		<p>Along an opening in the rock. &rsquo;Midst them</p>
		<p>I also low shall fall, soon as he comes,</p>
		<p>For whom I took thee, when so hastily</p>
		<p>I question&rsquo;d. But already longer time</p>
		<p>Hath pass&rsquo;d, since my souls kindled, and I thus</p>
		<p>Upturn&rsquo;d have stood, than is his doom to stand</p>
		<p>Planted with fiery feet. For after him,</p>
		<p>One yet of deeds more ugly shall arrive,</p>
		<p>From forth the west, a shepherd without law,</p>
		<p>Fated to cover both his form and mine.</p>
		<p>He a new Jason shall be call&rsquo;d, of whom</p>
		<p>In Maccabees we read; and favour such</p>
		<p>As to that priest his king indulgent show&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Shall be of France&rsquo;s monarch shown to him.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">I know not if I here too far presum&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>But in this strain I answer&rsquo;d: &ldquo;Tell me now,</p>
		<p>What treasures from St. Peter at the first</p>
		<p>Our Lord demanded, when he put the keys</p>
		<p>Into his charge? Surely he ask&rsquo;d no more</p>
		<p>But, Follow me! Nor Peter nor the rest</p>
		<p>Or gold or silver of Matthias took,</p>
		<p>When lots were cast upon the forfeit place</p>
		<p>Of the condemned soul. Abide thou then;</p>
		<p>Thy punishment of right is merited:</p>
		<p>And look thou well to that ill-gotten coin,</p>
		<p>Which against Charles thy hardihood inspir&rsquo;d.</p>
		<p>If reverence of the keys restrain&rsquo;d me not,</p>
		<p>Which thou in happier time didst hold, I yet</p>
		<p>Severer speech might use. Your avarice</p>
		<p>O&rsquo;ercasts the world with mourning, under foot</p>
		<p>Treading the good, and raising bad men up.</p>
		<p>Of shepherds, like to you, th&rsquo; Evangelist</p>
		<p>Was ware, when her, who sits upon the waves,</p>
		<p>With kings in filthy whoredom he beheld,</p>
		<p>She who with seven heads tower&rsquo;d at her birth,</p>
		<p>And from ten horns her proof of glory drew,</p>
		<p>Long as her spouse in virtue took delight.</p>
		<p>Of gold and silver ye have made your god,</p>
		<p>Diff&rsquo;ring wherein from the idolater,</p>
		<p>But he that worships one, a hundred ye?</p>
		<p>Ah, Constantine! to how much ill gave birth,</p>
		<p>Not thy conversion, but that plenteous dower,</p>
		<p>Which the first wealthy Father gain&rsquo;d from thee!&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Meanwhile, as thus I sung, he, whether wrath</p>
		<p>Or conscience smote him, violent upsprang</p>
		<p>Spinning on either sole. I do believe</p>
		<p>My teacher well was pleas&rsquo;d, with so compos&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>A lip, he listen&rsquo;d ever to the sound</p>
		<p>Of the true words I utter&rsquo;d. In both arms</p>
		<p>He caught, and to his bosom lifting me</p>
		<p>Upward retrac&rsquo;d the way of his descent.</p>
		<p class="slindent">Nor weary of his weight he press&rsquo;d me close,</p>
		<p>Till to the summit of the rock we came,</p>
		<p>Our passage from the fourth to the fifth pier.</p>
		<p>His cherish&rsquo;d burden there gently he plac&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Upon the rugged rock and steep, a path</p>

		<p>Of the first song, whose awful theme records</p>
		<p>The spirits whelm&rsquo;d in woe. Earnest I look&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Into the depth, that open&rsquo;d to my view,</p>
		<p>Moisten&rsquo;d with tears of anguish, and beheld</p>
		<p>A tribe, that came along the hollow vale,</p>
		<p>In silence weeping: such their step as walk</p>
		<p>Quires chanting solemn litanies on earth.</p>
		<p class="slindent">As on them more direct mine eye descends,</p>

		<p>At the neck-bone, so that the countenance</p>
		<p>Was from the reins averted: and because</p>
		<p>None might before him look, they were compell&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>To&rsquo; advance with backward gait. Thus one perhaps</p>
		<p>Hath been by force of palsy clean transpos&rsquo;d,</p>

		<p>That on the hinder parts fall&rsquo;n from the face</p>
		<p>The tears down-streaming roll&rsquo;d. Against a rock</p>
		<p>I leant and wept, so that my guide exclaim&rsquo;d:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;What, and art thou too witless as the rest?</p>
		<p>Here pity most doth show herself alive,</p>
		<p>When she is dead. What guilt exceedeth his,</p>
		<p>Who with Heaven&rsquo;s judgment in his passion strives?</p>

		<p>&lsquo;Why leavest thou the war?&rsquo; He not the less</p>
		<p>Fell ruining far as to Minos down,</p>
		<p>Whose grapple none eludes. Lo! how he makes</p>
		<p>The breast his shoulders, and who once too far</p>
		<p>Before him wish&rsquo;d to see, now backward looks,</p>
		<p>And treads reverse his path. Tiresias note,</p>
		<p>Who semblance chang&rsquo;d, when woman he became</p>
		<p>Of male, through every limb transform&rsquo;d, and then</p>
		<p>Once more behov&rsquo;d him with his rod to strike</p>

		<p>Fix&rsquo;d in my native land, whence a short space</p>
		<p>My words detain thy audience. When her sire</p>
		<p>From life departed, and in servitude</p>
		<p>The city dedicate to Bacchus mourn&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Long time she went a wand&rsquo;rer through the world.</p>
		<p>Aloft in Italy&rsquo;s delightful land</p>
		<p>A lake there lies, at foot of that proud Alp,</p>
		<p>That o&rsquo;er the Tyrol locks Germania in,</p>
		<p>Its name Benacus, which a thousand rills,</p>
		<p>Methinks, and more, water between the vale</p>
		<p>Camonica and Garda and the height</p>
		<p>Of Apennine remote. There is a spot</p>
		<p>At midway of that lake, where he who bears</p>
		<p>Of Trento&rsquo;s flock the past&rsquo;ral staff, with him</p>
		<p>Of Brescia, and the Veronese, might each</p>
		<p>Passing that way his benediction give.</p>
		<p>A garrison of goodly site and strong</p>
		<p>Peschiera stands, to awe with front oppos&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>The Bergamese and Brescian, whence the shore</p>
		<p>More slope each way descends. There, whatsoev&rsquo;er</p>
		<p>Benacus&rsquo; bosom holds not, tumbling o&rsquo;er</p>
		<p>Down falls, and winds a river flood beneath</p>
		<p>Through the green pastures. Soon as in his course</p>
		<p>The steam makes head, Benacus then no more</p>
		<p>They call the name, but Mincius, till at last</p>
		<p>Reaching Governo into Po he falls.</p>
		<p>Not far his course hath run, when a wide flat</p>
		<p>It finds, which overstretchmg as a marsh</p>
		<p>It covers, pestilent in summer oft.</p>
		<p>Hence journeying, the savage maiden saw</p>
		<p>&rsquo;Midst of the fen a territory waste</p>
		<p>And naked of inhabitants. To shun</p>
		<p>All human converse, here she with her slaves</p>
		<p>Plying her arts remain&rsquo;d, and liv&rsquo;d, and left</p>
		<p>Her body tenantless. Thenceforth the tribes,</p>
		<p>Who round were scatter&rsquo;d, gath&rsquo;ring to that place</p>
		<p>Assembled; for its strength was great, enclos&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>On all parts by the fen. On those dead bones</p>
		<p>They rear&rsquo;d themselves a city, for her sake,</p>
		<p>Calling it Mantua, who first chose the spot,</p>
		<p>Nor ask&rsquo;d another omen for the name,</p>
		<p>Wherein more numerous the people dwelt,</p>
		<p>Ere Casalodi&rsquo;s madness by deceit</p>
		<p>Was wrong&rsquo;d of Pinamonte. If thou hear</p>
		<p>Henceforth another origin assign&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Of that my country, I forewarn thee now,</p>

		<p class="slindent">In the Venetians&rsquo; arsenal as boils</p>
		<p>Through wintry months tenacious pitch, to smear</p>
		<p>Their unsound vessels; for th&rsquo; inclement time</p>
		<p>Sea-faring men restrains, and in that while</p>
		<p>His bark one builds anew, another stops</p>
		<p>The ribs of his, that hath made many a voyage;</p>
		<p>One hammers at the prow, one at the poop;</p>
		<p>This shapeth oars, that other cables twirls,</p>
		<p>The mizen one repairs and main-sail rent</p>
		<p>So not by force of fire but art divine</p>
		<p>Boil&rsquo;d here a glutinous thick mass, that round</p>
		<p>Lim&rsquo;d all the shore beneath. I that beheld,</p>
		<p>But therein nought distinguish&rsquo;d, save the surge,</p>
		<p>Rais&rsquo;d by the boiling, in one mighty swell</p>
		<p>Heave, and by turns subsiding and fall. While there</p>
		<p>I fix&rsquo;d my ken below, &ldquo;Mark! mark!&rdquo; my guide</p>
		<p>Exclaiming, drew me towards him from the place,</p>
		<p>Wherein I stood. I turn&rsquo;d myself as one,</p>
		<p>Impatient to behold that which beheld</p>
		<p>He needs must shun, whom sudden fear unmans,</p>
		<p>That he his flight delays not for the view.</p>
		<p>Behind me I discern&rsquo;d a devil black,</p>
		<p>That running, up advanc&rsquo;d along the rock.</p>
		<p>Ah! what fierce cruelty his look bespake!</p>
		<p>In act how bitter did he seem, with wings</p>
		<p>Buoyant outstretch&rsquo;d and feet of nimblest tread!</p>
		<p>His shoulder proudly eminent and sharp</p>
		<p>Was with a sinner charg&rsquo;d; by either haunch</p>
		<p>He held him, the foot&rsquo;s sinew griping fast.</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Ye of our bridge!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;keen-talon&rsquo;d fiends!</p>
		<p>Lo! one of Santa Zita&rsquo;s elders! Him</p>
		<p>Whelm ye beneath, while I return for more.</p>
		<p>That land hath store of such. All men are there,</p>
		<p>Except Bonturo, barterers: of &lsquo;no&rsquo;</p>
		<p>For lucre there an &lsquo;aye&rsquo; is quickly made.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Him dashing down, o&rsquo;er the rough rock he turn&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Nor ever after thief a mastiff loos&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Sped with like eager haste. That other sank</p>
		<p>And forthwith writing to the surface rose.</p>
		<p>But those dark demons, shrouded by the bridge,</p>
		<p>Cried &ldquo;Here the hallow&rsquo;d visage saves not: here</p>
		<p>Is other swimming than in Serchio&rsquo;s wave.</p>
		<p>Wherefore if thou desire we rend thee not,</p>
		<p>Take heed thou mount not o&rsquo;er the pitch.&rdquo; This said,</p>
		<p>They grappled him with more than hundred hooks,</p>
		<p>And shouted: &ldquo;Cover&rsquo;d thou must sport thee here;</p>
		<p>So, if thou canst, in secret mayst thou filch.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>E&rsquo;en thus the cook bestirs him, with his grooms,</p>
		<p>To thrust the flesh into the caldron down</p>
		<p>With flesh-hooks, that it float not on the top.</p>
		<p class="slindent">Me then my guide bespake: &ldquo;Lest they descry,</p>
		<p>That thou art here, behind a craggy rock</p>
		<p>Bend low and screen thee; and whate&rsquo;er of force</p>
		<p>Be offer&rsquo;d me, or insult, fear thou not:</p>
		<p>For I am well advis&rsquo;d, who have been erst</p>
		<p>In the like fray.&rdquo; Beyond the bridge&rsquo;s head</p>
		<p>Therewith he pass&rsquo;d, and reaching the sixth pier,</p>
		<p>Behov&rsquo;d him then a forehead terror-proof.</p>
		<p class="slindent">With storm and fury, as when dogs rush forth</p>
		<p>Upon the poor man&rsquo;s back, who suddenly</p>
		<p>From whence he standeth makes his suit; so rush&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Those from beneath the arch, and against him</p>
		<p>Their weapons all they pointed. He aloud:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Be none of you outrageous: ere your time</p>
		<p>Dare seize me, come forth from amongst you one,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Who having heard my words, decide he then</p>
		<p>If he shall tear these limbs.&rdquo; They shouted loud,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Go, Malacoda!&rdquo; Whereat one advanc&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>The others standing firm, and as he came,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;What may this turn avail him?&rdquo; he exclaim&rsquo;d.</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Believ&rsquo;st thou, Malacoda! I had come</p>
		<p>Thus far from all your skirmishing secure,&rdquo;</p>
		<p>My teacher answered, &ldquo;without will divine</p>
		<p>And destiny propitious? Pass we then</p>
		<p>For so Heaven&rsquo;s pleasure is, that I should lead</p>
		<p>Another through this savage wilderness.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Forthwith so fell his pride, that he let drop</p>
		<p>The instrument of torture at his feet,</p>
		<p>And to the rest exclaim&rsquo;d: &ldquo;We have no power</p>
		<p>To strike him.&rdquo; Then to me my guide: &ldquo;O thou!</p>
		<p>Who on the bridge among the crags dost sit</p>
		<p>Low crouching, safely now to me return.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">I rose, and towards him moved with speed: the fiends</p>
		<p>Meantime all forward drew: me terror seiz&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Lest they should break the compact they had made.</p>
		<p>Thus issuing from Caprona, once I saw</p>
		<p>Th&rsquo; infantry dreading, lest his covenant</p>
		<p>The foe should break; so close he hemm&rsquo;d them round.</p>
		<p class="slindent">I to my leader&rsquo;s side adher&rsquo;d, mine eyes</p>
		<p>With fixt and motionless observance bent</p>
		<p>On their unkindly visage. They their hooks</p>
		<p>Protruding, one the other thus bespake:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Wilt thou I touch him on the hip?&rdquo; To whom</p>
		<p>Was answer&rsquo;d: &ldquo;Even so; nor miss thy aim.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">But he, who was in conf&rsquo;rence with my guide,</p>
		<p>Turn&rsquo;d rapid round, and thus the demon spake:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Stay, stay thee, Scarmiglione!&rdquo; Then to us</p>
		<p>He added: &ldquo;Further footing to your step</p>
		<p>This rock affords not, shiver&rsquo;d to the base</p>
		<p>Of the sixth arch. But would you still proceed,</p>
		<p>Up by this cavern go: not distant far,</p>
		<p>Another rock will yield you passage safe.</p>
		<p>Yesterday, later by five hours than now,</p>
		<p>Twelve hundred threescore years and six had fill&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>The circuit of their course, since here the way</p>
		<p>Was broken. Thitherward I straight dispatch</p>
		<p>Certain of these my scouts, who shall espy</p>
		<p>If any on the surface bask. With them</p>
		<p>Go ye: for ye shall find them nothing fell.</p>
		<p>Come Alichino forth,&rdquo; with that he cried,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;And Calcabrina, and Cagnazzo thou!</p>
		<p>The troop of ten let Barbariccia lead.</p>
		<p>With Libicocco Draghinazzo haste,</p>
		<p>Fang&rsquo;d Ciriatto, Grafflacane fierce,</p>
		<p>And Farfarello, and mad Rubicant.</p>
		<p>Search ye around the bubbling tar. For these,</p>
		<p>In safety lead them, where the other crag</p>
		<p>Uninterrupted traverses the dens.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">I then: &ldquo;O master! what a sight is there!</p>
		<p>Ah! without escort, journey we alone,</p>
		<p>Which, if thou know the way, I covet not.</p>
		<p>Unless thy prudence fail thee, dost not mark</p>
		<p>How they do gnarl upon us, and their scowl</p>
		<p>Threatens us present tortures?&rdquo; He replied:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I charge thee fear not: let them, as they will,</p>
		<p>Gnarl on: &rsquo;t is but in token of their spite</p>
		<p>Against the souls, who mourn in torment steep&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">To leftward o&rsquo;er the pier they turn&rsquo;d; but each</p>
		<p>Had first between his teeth prest close the tongue,</p>
		<p>Toward their leader for a signal looking,</p>
		<p>Which he with sound obscene triumphant gave.</p>

		<p>Light-armed squadrons and fleet foragers</p>

		<p>All things whate&rsquo;er the chasm contain&rsquo;d, and those</p>

		<p>Then hid more nimbly than the lightning glance.</p>
		<p class="slindent">E&rsquo;en as the frogs, that of a wat&rsquo;ry moat</p>

		<p>Their feet and of the trunk all else concealed,</p>

		<p>My heart doth stagger, one, that waited thus,</p>
		<p>As it befalls that oft one frog remains,</p>
		<p>While the next springs away: and Graffiacan,</p>
		<p>Who of the fiends was nearest, grappling seiz&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>His clotted locks, and dragg&rsquo;d him sprawling up,</p>
		<p>That he appear&rsquo;d to me an otter. Each</p>
		<p>Already by their names I knew, so well</p>
		<p>When they were chosen, I observ&rsquo;d, and mark&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>How one the other call&rsquo;d. &ldquo;O Rubicant!</p>
		<p>See that his hide thou with thy talons flay,&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Shouted together all the cursed crew.</p>
		<p class="slindent">Then I: &ldquo;Inform thee, master! if thou may,</p>
		<p>What wretched soul is this, on whom their hand</p>
		<p>His foes have laid.&rdquo; My leader to his side</p>
		<p>Approach&rsquo;d, and whence he came inquir&rsquo;d, to whom</p>
		<p>Was answer&rsquo;d thus: &ldquo;Born in Navarre&rsquo;s domain</p>
		<p>My mother plac&rsquo;d me in a lord&rsquo;s retinue,</p>
		<p>For she had borne me to a losel vile,</p>
		<p>A spendthrift of his substance and himself.</p>
		<p>The good king Thibault after that I serv&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>To peculating here my thoughts were turn&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Whereof I give account in this dire heat.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Straight Ciriatto, from whose mouth a tusk</p>
		<p>Issued on either side, as from a boar,</p>
		<p>Ript him with one of these. &rsquo;Twixt evil claws</p>
		<p>The mouse had fall&rsquo;n: but Barbariccia cried,</p>
		<p>Seizing him with both arms: &ldquo;Stand thou apart,</p>
		<p>While I do fix him on my prong transpierc&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Then added, turning to my guide his face,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Inquire of him, if more thou wish to learn,</p>
		<p>Ere he again be rent.&rdquo; My leader thus:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Then tell us of the partners in thy guilt;</p>
		<p>Knowest thou any sprung of Latian land</p>
		<p>Under the tar?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I parted,&rdquo; he replied,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;But now from one, who sojourn&rsquo;d not far thence;</p>
		<p>So were I under shelter now with him!</p>
		<p>Nor hook nor talon then should scare me more.&rdquo;&mdash;.</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Too long we suffer,&rdquo; Libicocco cried,</p>
		<p>Then, darting forth a prong, seiz&rsquo;d on his arm,</p>
		<p>And mangled bore away the sinewy part.</p>
		<p>Him Draghinazzo by his thighs beneath</p>
		<p>Would next have caught, whence angrily their chief,</p>
		<p>Turning on all sides round, with threat&rsquo;ning brow</p>
		<p>Restrain&rsquo;d them. When their strife a little ceas&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Of him, who yet was gazing on his wound,</p>
		<p>My teacher thus without delay inquir&rsquo;d:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Who was the spirit, from whom by evil hap</p>
		<p>Parting, as thou has told, thou cam&rsquo;st to shore?&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;It was the friar Gomita,&rdquo; he rejoin&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;He of Gallura, vessel of all guile,</p>
		<p>Who had his master&rsquo;s enemies in hand,</p>
		<p>And us&rsquo;d them so that they commend him well.</p>
		<p>Money he took, and them at large dismiss&rsquo;d.</p>
		<p>So he reports: and in each other charge</p>
		<p>Committed to his keeping, play&rsquo;d the part</p>
		<p>Of barterer to the height: with him doth herd</p>
		<p>The chief of Logodoro, Michel Zanche.</p>
		<p>Sardinia is a theme, whereof their tongue</p>
		<p>Is never weary. Out! alas! behold</p>
		<p>That other, how he grins! More would I say,</p>
		<p>But tremble lest he mean to maul me sore.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Their captain then to Farfarello turning,</p>
		<p>Who roll&rsquo;d his moony eyes in act to strike,</p>
		<p>Rebuk&rsquo;d him thus: &ldquo;Off! cursed bird! Avaunt!&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;If ye desire to see or hear,&rdquo; he thus</p>
		<p>Quaking with dread resum&rsquo;d, &ldquo;or Tuscan spirits</p>
		<p>Or Lombard, I will cause them to appear.</p>
		<p>Meantime let these ill talons bate their fury,</p>
		<p>So that no vengeance they may fear from them,</p>
		<p>And I, remaining in this self-same place,</p>
		<p>Will for myself but one, make sev&rsquo;n appear,</p>
		<p>When my shrill whistle shall be heard; for so</p>
		<p>Our custom is to call each other up.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Cagnazzo at that word deriding grinn&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Then wagg&rsquo;d the head and spake: &ldquo;Hear his device,</p>
		<p>Mischievous as he is, to plunge him down.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Whereto he thus, who fail&rsquo;d not in rich store</p>
		<p>Of nice-wove toils; &ldquo;Mischief forsooth extreme,</p>
		<p>Meant only to procure myself more woe!&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">No longer Alichino then refrain&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>But thus, the rest gainsaying, him bespake:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;If thou do cast thee down, I not on foot</p>
		<p>Will chase thee, but above the pitch will beat</p>
		<p>My plumes. Quit we the vantage ground, and let</p>
		<p>The bank be as a shield, that we may see</p>
		<p>If singly thou prevail against us all.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Now, reader, of new sport expect to hear!</p>
		<p class="slindent">They each one turn&rsquo;d his eyes to the&rsquo; other shore,</p>
		<p>He first, who was the hardest to persuade.</p>
		<p>The spirit of Navarre chose well his time,</p>
		<p>Planted his feet on land, and at one leap</p>
		<p>Escaping disappointed their resolve.</p>
		<p class="slindent">Them quick resentment stung, but him the most,</p>
		<p>Who was the cause of failure; in pursuit</p>
		<p>He therefore sped, exclaiming; &ldquo;Thou art caught.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">But little it avail&rsquo;d: terror outstripp&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>His following flight: the other plung&rsquo;d beneath,</p>
		<p>And he with upward pinion rais&rsquo;d his breast:</p>
		<p>E&rsquo;en thus the water-fowl, when she perceives</p>
		<p>The falcon near, dives instant down, while he</p>
		<p>Enrag&rsquo;d and spent retires. That mockery</p>
		<p>In Calcabrina fury stirr&rsquo;d, who flew</p>
		<p>After him, with desire of strife inflam&rsquo;d;</p>
		<p>And, for the barterer had &rsquo;scap&rsquo;d, so turn&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>His talons on his comrade. O&rsquo;er the dyke</p>
		<p>In grapple close they join&rsquo;d; but the&rsquo; other prov&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>A goshawk able to rend well his foe;</p>
		<p>And in the boiling lake both fell. The heat</p>
		<p>Was umpire soon between them, but in vain</p>
		<p>To lift themselves they strove, so fast were glued</p>
		<p>Their pennons. Barbariccia, as the rest,</p>
		<p>That chance lamenting, four in flight dispatch&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>From the&rsquo; other coast, with all their weapons arm&rsquo;d.</p>
		<p>They, to their post on each side speedily</p>
		<p>Descending, stretch&rsquo;d their hooks toward the fiends,</p>
		<p>Who flounder&rsquo;d, inly burning from their scars:</p>
		<p>And we departing left them to that broil.</p>

		<p><span class="sc">In</span> silence and in solitude we went,</p>
		<p>One first, the other following his steps,</p>
		<p>As minor friars journeying on their road.</p>
		<p class="slindent">The present fray had turn&rsquo;d my thoughts to muse</p>
		<p>Upon old Aesop&rsquo;s fable, where he told</p>
		<p>What fate unto the mouse and frog befell.</p>
		<p>For language hath not sounds more like in sense,</p>
		<p>Than are these chances, if the origin</p>
		<p>And end of each be heedfully compar&rsquo;d.</p>
		<p>And as one thought bursts from another forth,</p>
		<p>So afterward from that another sprang,</p>
		<p>Which added doubly to my former fear.</p>
		<p>For thus I reason&rsquo;d: &ldquo;These through us have been</p>
		<p>So foil&rsquo;d, with loss and mock&rsquo;ry so complete,</p>
		<p>As needs must sting them sore. If anger then</p>
		<p>Be to their evil will conjoin&rsquo;d, more fell</p>
		<p>They shall pursue us, than the savage hound</p>
		<p>Snatches the leveret, panting &rsquo;twixt his jaws.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Already I perceiv&rsquo;d my hair stand all</p>
		<p>On end with terror, and look&rsquo;d eager back.</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Teacher,&rdquo; I thus began, &ldquo;if speedily</p>
		<p>Thyself and me thou hide not, much I dread</p>
		<p>Those evil talons. Even now behind</p>
		<p>They urge us: quick imagination works</p>
		<p>So forcibly, that I already feel them.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">He answer&rsquo;d: &ldquo;Were I form&rsquo;d of leaded glass,</p>
		<p>I should not sooner draw unto myself</p>
		<p>Thy outward image, than I now imprint</p>
		<p>That from within. This moment came thy thoughts</p>
		<p>Presented before mine, with similar act</p>
		<p>And count&rsquo;nance similar, so that from both</p>
		<p>I one design have fram&rsquo;d. If the right coast</p>
		<p>Incline so much, that we may thence descend</p>
		<p>Into the other chasm, we shall escape</p>
		<p>Secure from this imagined pursuit.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">He had not spoke his purpose to the end,</p>
		<p>When I from far beheld them with spread wings</p>
		<p>Approach to take us. Suddenly my guide</p>
		<p>Caught me, ev&rsquo;n as a mother that from sleep</p>
		<p>Is by the noise arous&rsquo;d, and near her sees</p>
		<p>The climbing fires, who snatches up her babe</p>
		<p>And flies ne&rsquo;er pausing, careful more of him</p>
		<p>Than of herself, that but a single vest</p>
		<p>Clings round her limbs. Down from the jutting beach</p>
		<p>Supine he cast him, to that pendent rock,</p>
		<p>Which closes on one part the other chasm.</p>
		<p class="slindent">Never ran water with such hurrying pace</p>
		<p>Adown the tube to turn a landmill&rsquo;s wheel,</p>
		<p>When nearest it approaches to the spokes,</p>
		<p>As then along that edge my master ran,</p>
		<p>Carrying me in his bosom, as a child,</p>
		<p>Not a companion. Scarcely had his feet</p>
		<p>Reach&rsquo;d to the lowest of the bed beneath,</p>
		<p>When over us the steep they reach&rsquo;d; but fear</p>
		<p>In him was none; for that high Providence,</p>
		<p>Which plac&rsquo;d them ministers of the fifth foss,</p>
		<p>Power of departing thence took from them all.</p>
		<p class="slindent">There in the depth we saw a painted tribe,</p>
		<p>Who pac&rsquo;d with tardy steps around, and wept,</p>
		<p>Faint in appearance and o&rsquo;ercome with toil.</p>
		<p>Caps had they on, with hoods, that fell low down</p>
		<p>Before their eyes, in fashion like to those</p>
		<p>Worn by the monks in Cologne. Their outside</p>
		<p>Was overlaid with gold, dazzling to view,</p>
		<p>But leaden all within, and of such weight,</p>
		<p>That Frederick&rsquo;s compar&rsquo;d to these were straw.</p>
		<p>Oh, everlasting wearisome attire!</p>
		<p class="slindent">We yet once more with them together turn&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>To leftward, on their dismal moan intent.</p>
		<p>But by the weight oppress&rsquo;d, so slowly came</p>
		<p>The fainting people, that our company</p>
		<p>Was chang&rsquo;d at every movement of the step.</p>
		<p class="slindent">Whence I my guide address&rsquo;d: &ldquo;See that thou find</p>
		<p>Some spirit, whose name may by his deeds be known,</p>
		<p>And to that end look round thee as thou go&rsquo;st.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Then one, who understood the Tuscan voice,</p>
		<p>Cried after us aloud: &ldquo;Hold in your feet,</p>
		<p>Ye who so swiftly speed through the dusk air.</p>
		<p>Perchance from me thou shalt obtain thy wish.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Whereat my leader, turning, me bespake:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Pause, and then onward at their pace proceed.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">I staid, and saw two Spirits in whose look</p>
		<p>Impatient eagerness of mind was mark&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>To overtake me; but the load they bare</p>
		<p>And narrow path retarded their approach.</p>
		<p class="slindent">Soon as arriv&rsquo;d, they with an eye askance</p>
		<p>Perus&rsquo;d me, but spake not: then turning each</p>
		<p>To other thus conferring said: &ldquo;This one</p>
		<p>Seems, by the action of his throat, alive.</p>
		<p>And, be they dead, what privilege allows</p>
		<p>They walk unmantled by the cumbrous stole?&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Then thus to me: &ldquo;Tuscan, who visitest</p>
		<p>The college of the mourning hypocrites,</p>
		<p>Disdain not to instruct us who thou art.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;By Arno&rsquo;s pleasant stream,&rdquo; I thus replied,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;In the great city I was bred and grew,</p>
		<p>And wear the body I have ever worn.</p>
		<p>but who are ye, from whom such mighty grief,</p>
		<p>As now I witness, courseth down your cheeks?</p>
		<p>What torment breaks forth in this bitter woe?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Our bonnets gleaming bright with orange hue,&rdquo;</p>

		<p>He Loderingo nam&rsquo;d, and by thy land</p>
		<p>Together taken, as men used to take</p>
		<p>A single and indifferent arbiter,</p>
		<p>To reconcile their strifes. How there we sped,</p>

		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;O friars!&rdquo; I began, &ldquo;your miseries&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
		<p>But there brake off, for one had caught my eye,</p>
		<p>Fix&rsquo;d to a cross with three stakes on the ground:</p>
		<p>He, when he saw me, writh&rsquo;d himself, throughout</p>
		<p>Distorted, ruffling with deep sighs his beard.</p>
		<p>And Catalano, who thereof was &rsquo;ware,</p>
		<p>Thus spake: &ldquo;That pierced spirit, whom intent</p>
		<p>Thou view&rsquo;st, was he who gave the Pharisees</p>
		<p>Counsel, that it were fitting for one man</p>
		<p>To suffer for the people. He doth lie</p>
		<p>Transverse; nor any passes, but him first</p>
		<p>Behoves make feeling trial how each weighs.</p>
		<p>In straits like this along the foss are plac&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>The father of his consort, and the rest</p>
		<p>Partakers in that council, seed of ill</p>
		<p>And sorrow to the Jews.&rdquo; I noted then,</p>
		<p>How Virgil gaz&rsquo;d with wonder upon him,</p>
		<p>Thus abjectly extended on the cross</p>
		<p>In banishment eternal. To the friar</p>
		<p>He next his words address&rsquo;d: &ldquo;We pray ye tell,</p>
		<p>If so be lawful, whether on our right</p>
		<p>Lies any opening in the rock, whereby</p>
		<p>We both may issue hence, without constraint</p>
		<p>On the dark angels, that compell&rsquo;d they come</p>
		<p>To lead us from this depth.&rdquo; He thus replied:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Nearer than thou dost hope, there is a rock</p>
		<p>From the next circle moving, which o&rsquo;ersteps</p>
		<p>Each vale of horror, save that here his cope</p>
		<p>Is shatter&rsquo;d. By the ruin ye may mount:</p>
		<p>For on the side it slants, and most the height</p>
		<p>Rises below.&rdquo; With head bent down awhile</p>
		<p>My leader stood, then spake: &ldquo;He warn&rsquo;d us ill,</p>
		<p>Who yonder hangs the sinners on his hook.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">To whom the friar: At Bologna erst</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I many vices of the devil heard,</p>
		<p>Among the rest was said, &lsquo;He is a liar,</p>
		<p>And the father of lies!&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo; When he had spoke,</p>
		<p>My leader with large strides proceeded on,</p>
		<p>Somewhat disturb&rsquo;d with anger in his look.</p>
		<p class="slindent">I therefore left the spirits heavy laden,</p>
		<p>And following, his beloved footsteps mark&rsquo;d.</p>

		<p><span class="sc">In</span> the year&rsquo;s early nonage, when the sun</p>
		<p>Tempers his tresses in Aquarius&rsquo; urn,</p>
		<p>And now towards equal day the nights recede,</p>
		<p>When as the rime upon the earth puts on</p>
		<p>Her dazzling sister&rsquo;s image, but not long</p>
		<p>Her milder sway endures, then riseth up</p>
		<p>The village hind, whom fails his wintry store,</p>
		<p>And looking out beholds the plain around</p>
		<p>All whiten&rsquo;d, whence impatiently he smites</p>
		<p>His thighs, and to his hut returning in,</p>
		<p>There paces to and fro, wailing his lot,</p>
		<p>As a discomfited and helpless man;</p>
		<p>Then comes he forth again, and feels new hope</p>
		<p>Spring in his bosom, finding e&rsquo;en thus soon</p>
		<p>The world hath chang&rsquo;d its count&rsquo;nance, grasps his crook,</p>
		<p>And forth to pasture drives his little flock:</p>
		<p>So me my guide dishearten&rsquo;d when I saw</p>
		<p>His troubled forehead, and so speedily</p>
		<p>That ill was cur&rsquo;d; for at the fallen bridge</p>
		<p>Arriving, towards me with a look as sweet,</p>
		<p>He turn&rsquo;d him back, as that I first beheld</p>
		<p>At the steep mountain&rsquo;s foot. Regarding well</p>
		<p>The ruin, and some counsel first maintain&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>With his own thought, he open&rsquo;d wide his arm</p>
		<p>And took me up. As one, who, while he works,</p>
		<p>Computes his labour&rsquo;s issue, that he seems</p>
		<p>Still to foresee the&rsquo; effect, so lifting me</p>
		<p>Up to the summit of one peak, he fix&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>His eye upon another. &ldquo;Grapple that,&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Said he, &ldquo;but first make proof, if it be such</p>
		<p>As will sustain thee.&rdquo; For one capp&rsquo;d with lead</p>
		<p>This were no journey. Scarcely he, though light,</p>
		<p>And I, though onward push&rsquo;d from crag to crag,</p>
		<p>Could mount. And if the precinct of this coast</p>
		<p>Were not less ample than the last, for him</p>
		<p>I know not, but my strength had surely fail&rsquo;d.</p>
		<p>But Malebolge all toward the mouth</p>
		<p>Inclining of the nethermost abyss,</p>
		<p>The site of every valley hence requires,</p>
		<p>That one side upward slope, the other fall.</p>
		<p class="slindent">At length the point of our descent we reach&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>From the last flag: soon as to that arriv&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>So was the breath exhausted from my lungs,</p>
		<p>I could no further, but did seat me there.</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Now needs thy best of man;&rdquo; so spake my guide:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;For not on downy plumes, nor under shade</p>
		<p>Of canopy reposing, fame is won,</p>
		<p>Without which whosoe&rsquo;er consumes his days</p>
		<p>Leaveth such vestige of himself on earth,</p>
		<p>As smoke in air or foam upon the wave.</p>
		<p>Thou therefore rise: vanish thy weariness</p>
		<p>By the mind&rsquo;s effort, in each struggle form&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>To vanquish, if she suffer not the weight</p>
		<p>Of her corporeal frame to crush her down.</p>
		<p>A longer ladder yet remains to scale.</p>
		<p>From these to have escap&rsquo;d sufficeth not.</p>
		<p>If well thou note me, profit by my words.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">I straightway rose, and show&rsquo;d myself less spent</p>
		<p>Than I in truth did feel me. &ldquo;On,&rdquo; I cried,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;For I am stout and fearless.&rdquo; Up the rock</p>
		<p>Our way we held, more rugged than before,</p>
		<p>Narrower and steeper far to climb. From talk</p>
		<p>I ceas&rsquo;d not, as we journey&rsquo;d, so to seem</p>
		<p>Least faint; whereat a voice from the other foss</p>
		<p>Did issue forth, for utt&rsquo;rance suited ill.</p>
		<p>Though on the arch that crosses there I stood,</p>
		<p>What were the words I knew not, but who spake</p>
		<p>Seem&rsquo;d mov&rsquo;d in anger. Down I stoop&rsquo;d to look,</p>
		<p>But my quick eye might reach not to the depth</p>
		<p>For shrouding darkness; wherefore thus I spake:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;To the next circle, Teacher, bend thy steps,</p>
		<p>And from the wall dismount we; for as hence</p>
		<p>I hear and understand not, so I see</p>
		<p>Beneath, and naught discern.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;I answer not,&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Said he, &ldquo;but by the deed. To fair request</p>
		<p>Silent performance maketh best return.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">We from the bridge&rsquo;s head descended, where</p>
		<p>To the eighth mound it joins, and then the chasm</p>
		<p>Opening to view, I saw a crowd within</p>
		<p>Of serpents terrible, so strange of shape</p>
		<p>And hideous, that remembrance in my veins</p>
		<p>Yet shrinks the vital current. Of her sands</p>
		<p>Let Lybia vaunt no more: if Jaculus,</p>
		<p>Pareas and Chelyder be her brood,</p>
		<p>Cenchris and Amphisboena, plagues so dire</p>
		<p>Or in such numbers swarming ne&rsquo;er she shew&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Not with all Ethiopia, and whate&rsquo;er</p>
		<p>Above the Erythraean sea is spawn&rsquo;d.</p>
		<p class="slindent">Amid this dread exuberance of woe</p>
		<p>Ran naked spirits wing&rsquo;d with horrid fear,</p>
		<p>Nor hope had they of crevice where to hide,</p>
		<p>Or heliotrope to charm them out of view.</p>
		<p>With serpents were their hands behind them bound,</p>
		<p>Which through their reins infix&rsquo;d the tail and head</p>
		<p>Twisted in folds before. And lo! on one</p>
		<p>Near to our side, darted an adder up,</p>
		<p>And, where the neck is on the shoulders tied,</p>
		<p>Transpierc&rsquo;d him. Far more quickly than e&rsquo;er pen</p>
		<p>Wrote O or I, he kindled, burn&rsquo;d, and chang&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>To ashes, all pour&rsquo;d out upon the earth.</p>
		<p>When there dissolv&rsquo;d he lay, the dust again</p>
		<p>Uproll&rsquo;d spontaneous, and the self-same form</p>
		<p>Instant resumed. So mighty sages tell,</p>
		<p>The&rsquo; Arabian Phoenix, when five hundred years</p>
		<p>Have well nigh circled, dies, and springs forthwith</p>
		<p>Renascent. Blade nor herb throughout his life</p>
		<p>He tastes, but tears of frankincense alone</p>
		<p>And odorous amomum: swaths of nard</p>
		<p>And myrrh his funeral shroud. As one that falls,</p>
		<p>He knows not how, by force demoniac dragg&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>To earth, or through obstruction fettering up</p>
		<p>In chains invisible the powers of man,</p>
		<p>Who, risen from his trance, gazeth around,</p>
		<p>Bewilder&rsquo;d with the monstrous agony</p>
		<p>He hath endur&rsquo;d, and wildly staring sighs;</p>
		<p>So stood aghast the sinner when he rose.</p>
		<p class="slindent">Oh! how severe God&rsquo;s judgment, that deals out</p>
		<p>Such blows in stormy vengeance! Who he was</p>
		<p>My teacher next inquir&rsquo;d, and thus in few</p>
		<p>He answer&rsquo;d: &ldquo;Vanni Fucci am I call&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Not long since rained down from Tuscany</p>
		<p>To this dire gullet. Me the beastial life</p>
		<p>And not the human pleas&rsquo;d, mule that I was,</p>
		<p>Who in Pistoia found my worthy den.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">I then to Virgil: &ldquo;Bid him stir not hence,</p>
		<p>And ask what crime did thrust him hither: once</p>
		<p>A man I knew him choleric and bloody.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">The sinner heard and feign&rsquo;d not, but towards me</p>
		<p>His mind directing and his face, wherein</p>
		<p>Was dismal shame depictur&rsquo;d, thus he spake:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;It grieves me more to have been caught by thee</p>
		<p>In this sad plight, which thou beholdest, than</p>
		<p>When I was taken from the other life.</p>
		<p>I have no power permitted to deny</p>
		<p>What thou inquirest. I am doom&rsquo;d thus low</p>
		<p>To dwell, for that the sacristy by me</p>
		<p>Was rifled of its goodly ornaments,</p>
		<p>And with the guilt another falsely charged.</p>
		<p>But that thou mayst not joy to see me thus,</p>
		<p>So as thou e&rsquo;er shalt &rsquo;scape this darksome realm</p>
		<p>Open thine ears and hear what I forebode.</p>
		<p>Reft of the Neri first Pistoia pines,</p>
		<p>Then Florence changeth citizens and laws.</p>
		<p>From Valdimagra, drawn by wrathful Mars,</p>
		<p>A vapour rises, wrapt in turbid mists,</p>
		<p>And sharp and eager driveth on the storm</p>
		<p>With arrowy hurtling o&rsquo;er Piceno&rsquo;s field,</p>
		<p>Whence suddenly the cloud shall burst, and strike</p>
		<p>Each helpless Bianco prostrate to the ground.</p>

		<p>Through all the gloomy circles of the&rsquo; abyss,</p>
		<p>Spirit, that swell&rsquo;d so proudly &rsquo;gainst his God,</p>
		<p>Not him, who headlong fell from Thebes. He fled,</p>
		<p>Nor utter&rsquo;d more; and after him there came</p>
		<p>A centaur full of fury, shouting, &ldquo;Where</p>
		<p>Where is the caitiff?&rdquo; On Maremma&rsquo;s marsh</p>
		<p>Swarm not the serpent tribe, as on his haunch</p>
		<p>They swarm&rsquo;d, to where the human face begins.</p>
		<p>Behind his head upon the shoulders lay,</p>
		<p>With open wings, a dragon breathing fire</p>
		<p>On whomsoe&rsquo;er he met. To me my guide:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Cacus is this, who underneath the rock</p>
		<p>Of Aventine spread oft a lake of blood.</p>
		<p>He, from his brethren parted, here must tread</p>
		<p>A different journey, for his fraudful theft</p>
		<p>Of the great herd, that near him stall&rsquo;d; whence found</p>
		<p>His felon deeds their end, beneath the mace</p>
		<p>Of stout Alcides, that perchance laid on</p>
		<p>A hundred blows, and not the tenth was felt.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">While yet he spake, the centaur sped away:</p>
		<p>And under us three spirits came, of whom</p>
		<p>Nor I nor he was ware, till they exclaim&rsquo;d;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Say who are ye?&rdquo; We then brake off discourse,</p>
		<p>Intent on these alone. I knew them not;</p>
		<p>But, as it chanceth oft, befell, that one</p>
		<p>Had need to name another. &ldquo;Where,&rdquo; said he,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Doth Cianfa lurk?&rdquo; I, for a sign my guide</p>
		<p>Should stand attentive, plac&rsquo;d against my lips</p>
		<p>The finger lifted. If, O reader! now</p>
		<p>Thou be not apt to credit what I tell,</p>
		<p>No marvel; for myself do scarce allow</p>
		<p>The witness of mine eyes. But as I looked</p>
		<p>Toward them, lo! a serpent with six feet</p>
		<p>Springs forth on one, and fastens full upon him:</p>
		<p>His midmost grasp&rsquo;d the belly, a forefoot</p>
		<p>Seiz&rsquo;d on each arm (while deep in either cheek</p>
		<p>He flesh&rsquo;d his fangs); the hinder on the thighs</p>
		<p>Were spread, &rsquo;twixt which the tail inserted curl&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Upon the reins behind. Ivy ne&rsquo;er clasp&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>A dodder&rsquo;d oak, as round the other&rsquo;s limbs</p>
		<p>The hideous monster intertwin&rsquo;d his own.</p>
		<p>Then, as they both had been of burning wax,</p>
		<p>Each melted into other, mingling hues,</p>
		<p>That which was either now was seen no more.</p>
		<p>Thus up the shrinking paper, ere it burns,</p>
		<p>A brown tint glides, not turning yet to black,</p>
		<p>And the clean white expires. The other two</p>
		<p>Look&rsquo;d on exclaiming: &ldquo;Ah, how dost thou change,</p>
		<p>Agnello! See! Thou art nor double now,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Nor only one.&rdquo; The two heads now became</p>
		<p>One, and two figures blended in one form</p>
		<p>Appear&rsquo;d, where both were lost. Of the four lengths</p>
		<p>Two arms were made: the belly and the chest</p>
		<p>The thighs and legs into such members chang&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>As never eye hath seen. Of former shape</p>
		<p>All trace was vanish&rsquo;d. Two yet neither seem&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>That image miscreate, and so pass&rsquo;d on</p>
		<p>With tardy steps. As underneath the scourge</p>
		<p>Of the fierce dog-star, that lays bare the fields,</p>
		<p>Shifting from brake to brake, the lizard seems</p>
		<p>A flash of lightning, if he thwart the road,</p>
		<p>So toward th&rsquo; entrails of the other two</p>
		<p>Approaching seem&rsquo;d, an adder all on fire,</p>
		<p>As the dark pepper-grain, livid and swart.</p>
		<p>In that part, whence our life is nourish&rsquo;d first,</p>
		<p>One he transpierc&rsquo;d; then down before him fell</p>
		<p>Stretch&rsquo;d out. The pierced spirit look&rsquo;d on him</p>
		<p>But spake not; yea stood motionless and yawn&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>As if by sleep or fev&rsquo;rous fit assail&rsquo;d.</p>
		<p>He ey&rsquo;d the serpent, and the serpent him.</p>
		<p>One from the wound, the other from the mouth</p>
		<p>Breath&rsquo;d a thick smoke, whose vap&rsquo;ry columns join&rsquo;d.</p>
		<p class="slindent">Lucan in mute attention now may hear,</p>
		<p>Nor thy disastrous fate, Sabellus! tell,</p>
		<p>Nor shine, Nasidius! Ovid now be mute.</p>
		<p>What if in warbling fiction he record</p>
		<p>Cadmus and Arethusa, to a snake</p>
		<p>Him chang&rsquo;d, and her into a fountain clear,</p>
		<p>I envy not; for never face to face</p>
		<p>Two natures thus transmuted did he sing,</p>
		<p>Wherein both shapes were ready to assume</p>
		<p>The other&rsquo;s substance. They in mutual guise</p>
		<p>So answer&rsquo;d, that the serpent split his train</p>
		<p>Divided to a fork, and the pierc&rsquo;d spirit</p>
		<p>Drew close his steps together, legs and thighs</p>
		<p>Compacted, that no sign of juncture soon</p>
		<p>Was visible: the tail disparted took</p>
		<p>The figure which the spirit lost, its skin</p>
		<p>Soft&rsquo;ning, his indurated to a rind.</p>
		<p>The shoulders next I mark&rsquo;d, that ent&rsquo;ring join&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>The monster&rsquo;s arm-pits, whose two shorter feet</p>
		<p>So lengthen&rsquo;d, as the other&rsquo;s dwindling shrunk.</p>
		<p>The feet behind then twisting up became</p>
		<p>That part that man conceals, which in the wretch</p>
		<p>Was cleft in twain. While both the shadowy smoke</p>
		<p>With a new colour veils, and generates</p>
		<p>Th&rsquo; excrescent pile on one, peeling it off</p>
		<p>From th&rsquo; other body, lo! upon his feet</p>
		<p>One upright rose, and prone the other fell.</p>
		<p>Not yet their glaring and malignant lamps</p>
		<p>Were shifted, though each feature chang&rsquo;d beneath.</p>
		<p>Of him who stood erect, the mounting face</p>
		<p>Retreated towards the temples, and what there</p>
		<p>Superfluous matter came, shot out in ears</p>
		<p>From the smooth cheeks, the rest, not backward dragg&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Of its excess did shape the nose; and swell&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Into due size protuberant the lips.</p>
		<p>He, on the earth who lay, meanwhile extends</p>
		<p>His sharpen&rsquo;d visage, and draws down the ears</p>
		<p>Into the head, as doth the slug his horns.</p>
		<p>His tongue continuous before and apt</p>
		<p>For utt&rsquo;rance, severs; and the other&rsquo;s fork</p>
		<p>Closing unites. That done the smoke was laid.</p>
		<p>The soul, transform&rsquo;d into the brute, glides off,</p>
		<p>Hissing along the vale, and after him</p>
		<p>The other talking sputters; but soon turn&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>His new-grown shoulders on him, and in few</p>
		<p>Thus to another spake: &ldquo;Along this path</p>
		<p>Crawling, as I have done, speed Buoso now!&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">So saw I fluctuate in successive change</p>
		<p>Th&rsquo; unsteady ballast of the seventh hold:</p>

		<p>I answer&rsquo;d, &ldquo;hath assur&rsquo;d me; yet I deem&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Already of the truth, already wish&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>To ask thee, who is in yon fire, that comes</p>
		<p>So parted at the summit, as it seem&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Ascending from that funeral pile, where lay</p>
		<p>The Theban brothers?&rdquo; He replied: &ldquo;Within</p>
		<p>Ulysses there and Diomede endure</p>
		<p>Their penal tortures, thus to vengeance now</p>
		<p>Together hasting, as erewhile to wrath.</p>
		<p>These in the flame with ceaseless groans deplore</p>
		<p>The ambush of the horse, that open&rsquo;d wide</p>
		<p>A portal for that goodly seed to pass,</p>
		<p>Which sow&rsquo;d imperial Rome; nor less the guile</p>
		<p>Lament they, whence of her Achilles &rsquo;reft</p>
		<p>Deidamia yet in death complains.</p>
		<p>And there is rued the stratagem, that Troy</p>
		<p>Of her Palladium spoil&rsquo;d.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;If they have power</p>
		<p>Of utt&rsquo;rance from within these sparks,&rdquo; said I,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;O master! think my prayer a thousand fold</p>
		<p>In repetition urg&rsquo;d, that thou vouchsafe</p>
		<p>To pause, till here the horned flame arrive.</p>
		<p>See, how toward it with desire I bend.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">He thus: &ldquo;Thy prayer is worthy of much praise,</p>
		<p>And I accept it therefore: but do thou</p>
		<p>Thy tongue refrain: to question them be mine,</p>
		<p>For I divine thy wish: and they perchance,</p>
		<p>For they were Greeks, might shun discourse with thee.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">When there the flame had come, where time and place</p>
		<p>Seem&rsquo;d fitting to my guide, he thus began:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;O ye, who dwell two spirits in one fire!</p>
		<p>If living I of you did merit aught,</p>
		<p>Whate&rsquo;er the measure were of that desert,</p>
		<p>When in the world my lofty strain I pour&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Move ye not on, till one of you unfold</p>
		<p>In what clime death o&rsquo;ertook him self-destroy&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Of the old flame forthwith the greater horn</p>
		<p>Began to roll, murmuring, as a fire</p>
		<p>That labours with the wind, then to and fro</p>
		<p>Wagging the top, as a tongue uttering sounds,</p>
		<p>Threw out its voice, and spake: &ldquo;When I escap&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>From Circe, who beyond a circling year</p>
		<p>Had held me near Caieta, by her charms,</p>
		<p>Ere thus Aeneas yet had nam&rsquo;d the shore,</p>
		<p>Nor fondness for my son, nor reverence</p>
		<p>Of my old father, nor return of love,</p>
		<p>That should have crown&rsquo;d Penelope with joy,</p>
		<p>Could overcome in me the zeal I had</p>
		<p>T&rsquo; explore the world, and search the ways of life,</p>
		<p>Man&rsquo;s evil and his virtue. Forth I sail&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Into the deep illimitable main,</p>
		<p>With but one bark, and the small faithful band</p>
		<p>That yet cleav&rsquo;d to me. As Iberia far,</p>
		<p>Far as Morocco either shore I saw,</p>
		<p>And the Sardinian and each isle beside</p>
		<p>Which round that ocean bathes. Tardy with age</p>
		<p>Were I and my companions, when we came</p>
		<p>To the strait pass, where Hercules ordain&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>The bound&rsquo;ries not to be o&rsquo;erstepp&rsquo;d by man.</p>
		<p>The walls of Seville to my right I left,</p>
		<p>On the&rsquo; other hand already Ceuta past.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;O brothers!&rdquo; I began, &ldquo;who to the west</p>
		<p>Through perils without number now have reach&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>To this the short remaining watch, that yet</p>
		<p>Our senses have to wake, refuse not proof</p>
		<p>Of the unpeopled world, following the track</p>
		<p>Of Phoebus. Call to mind from whence we sprang:</p>
		<p>Ye were not form&rsquo;d to live the life of brutes</p>
		<p>But virtue to pursue and knowledge high.</p>
		<p>With these few words I sharpen&rsquo;d for the voyage</p>
		<p>The mind of my associates, that I then</p>
		<p>Could scarcely have withheld them. To the dawn</p>
		<p>Our poop we turn&rsquo;d, and for the witless flight</p>
		<p>Made our oars wings, still gaining on the left.</p>
		<p>Each star of the&rsquo; other pole night now beheld,</p>
		<p>And ours so low, that from the ocean-floor</p>
		<p>It rose not. Five times re-illum&rsquo;d, as oft</p>
		<p>Vanish&rsquo;d the light from underneath the moon</p>
		<p>Since the deep way we enter&rsquo;d, when from far</p>
		<p>Appear&rsquo;d a mountain dim, loftiest methought</p>
		<p>Of all I e&rsquo;er beheld. Joy seiz&rsquo;d us straight,</p>
		<p>But soon to mourning changed. From the new land</p>
		<p>A whirlwind sprung, and at her foremost side</p>
		<p>Did strike the vessel. Thrice it whirl&rsquo;d her round</p>
		<p>With all the waves, the fourth time lifted up</p>
		<p>The poop, and sank the prow: so fate decreed:</p>
		<p>And over us the booming billow clos&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>From the mild poet gain&rsquo;d, when following came</p>
		<p>Another, from whose top a sound confus&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Forth issuing, drew our eyes that way to look.</p>
		<p class="slindent">As the Sicilian bull, that rightfully</p>
		<p>His cries first echoed, who had shap&rsquo;d its mould,</p>
		<p>Did so rebellow, with the voice of him</p>
		<p>Tormented, that the brazen monster seem&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Pierc&rsquo;d through with pain; thus while no way they found</p>
		<p>Nor avenue immediate through the flame,</p>
		<p>Into its language turn&rsquo;d the dismal words:</p>

		<p>Up from the point, which vibrating obey&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Their motion at the tongue, these sounds we heard:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;O thou! to whom I now direct my voice!</p>
		<p>That lately didst exclaim in Lombard phrase,</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Depart thou, I solicit thee no more,</p>
		<p>Though somewhat tardy I perchance arrive</p>
		<p>Let it not irk thee here to pause awhile,</p>
		<p>And with me parley: lo! it irks not me</p>
		<p>And yet I burn. If but e&rsquo;en now thou fall</p>
		<p>into this blind world, from that pleasant land</p>
		<p>Of Latium, whence I draw my sum of guilt,</p>
		<p>Tell me if those, who in Romagna dwell,</p>
		<p>Have peace or war. For of the mountains there</p>
		<p>Was I, betwixt Urbino and the height,</p>
		<p>Whence Tyber first unlocks his mighty flood.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Leaning I listen&rsquo;d yet with heedful ear,</p>
		<p>When, as he touch&rsquo;d my side, the leader thus:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Speak thou: he is a Latian.&rdquo; My reply</p>
		<p>Was ready, and I spake without delay:</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;O spirit! who art hidden here below!</p>
		<p>Never was thy Romagna without war</p>
		<p>In her proud tyrants&rsquo; bosoms, nor is now:</p>
		<p>But open war there left I none. The state,</p>
		<p>Ravenna hath maintain&rsquo;d this many a year,</p>
		<p>Is steadfast. There Polenta&rsquo;s eagle broods,</p>
		<p>And in his broad circumference of plume</p>
		<p>O&rsquo;ershadows Cervia. The green talons grasp</p>
		<p>The land, that stood erewhile the proof so long,</p>
		<p>And pil&rsquo;d in bloody heap the host of France.</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;The&rsquo; old mastiff of Verruchio and the young,</p>
		<p>That tore Montagna in their wrath, still make,</p>
		<p>Where they are wont, an augre of their fangs.</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Lamone&rsquo;s city and Santerno&rsquo;s range</p>
		<p>Under the lion of the snowy lair.</p>
		<p>Inconstant partisan! that changeth sides,</p>
		<p>Or ever summer yields to winter&rsquo;s frost.</p>
		<p>And she, whose flank is wash&rsquo;d of Savio&rsquo;s wave,</p>
		<p>As &rsquo;twixt the level and the steep she lies,</p>
		<p>Lives so &rsquo;twixt tyrant power and liberty.</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Now tell us, I entreat thee, who art thou?</p>
		<p>Be not more hard than others. In the world,</p>
		<p>So may thy name still rear its forehead high.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Then roar&rsquo;d awhile the fire, its sharpen&rsquo;d point</p>
		<p>On either side wav&rsquo;d, and thus breath&rsquo;d at last:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;If I did think, my answer were to one,</p>
		<p>Who ever could return unto the world,</p>
		<p>This flame should rest unshaken. But since ne&rsquo;er,</p>
		<p>If true be told me, any from this depth</p>
		<p>Has found his upward way, I answer thee,</p>
		<p>Nor fear lest infamy record the words.</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;A man of arms at first, I cloth&rsquo;d me then</p>
		<p>In good Saint Francis&rsquo; girdle, hoping so</p>
		<p>T&rsquo; have made amends. And certainly my hope</p>
		<p>Had fail&rsquo;d not, but that he, whom curses light on,</p>
		<p>The&rsquo; high priest again seduc&rsquo;d me into sin.</p>
		<p>And how and wherefore listen while I tell.</p>
		<p>Long as this spirit mov&rsquo;d the bones and pulp</p>
		<p>My mother gave me, less my deeds bespake</p>
		<p>The nature of the lion than the fox.</p>
		<p>All ways of winding subtlety I knew,</p>
		<p>And with such art conducted, that the sound</p>
		<p>Reach&rsquo;d the world&rsquo;s limit. Soon as to that part</p>
		<p>Of life I found me come, when each behoves</p>
		<p>To lower sails and gather in the lines;</p>
		<p>That which before had pleased me then I rued,</p>
		<p>And to repentance and confession turn&rsquo;d;</p>
		<p>Wretch that I was! and well it had bested me!</p>
		<p>The chief of the new Pharisees meantime,</p>
		<p>Waging his warfare near the Lateran,</p>
		<p>Not with the Saracens or Jews (his foes</p>
		<p>All Christians were, nor against Acre one</p>
		<p>Had fought, nor traffic&rsquo;d in the Soldan&rsquo;s land),</p>
		<p>He his great charge nor sacred ministry</p>
		<p>In himself, rev&rsquo;renc&rsquo;d, nor in me that cord,</p>
		<p>Which us&rsquo;d to mark with leanness whom it girded.</p>
		<p>As in Socrate, Constantine besought</p>
		<p>To cure his leprosy Sylvester&rsquo;s aid,</p>
		<p>So me to cure the fever of his pride</p>
		<p>This man besought: my counsel to that end</p>
		<p>He ask&rsquo;d: and I was silent: for his words</p>
		<p>Seem&rsquo;d drunken: but forthwith he thus resum&rsquo;d:</p>
		<p>&rsquo;From thy heart banish fear: of all offence</p>
		<p>I hitherto absolve thee. In return,</p>
		<p>Teach me my purpose so to execute,</p>
		<p>That Penestrino cumber earth no more.</p>
		<p>Heav&rsquo;n, as thou knowest, I have power to shut</p>
		<p>And open: and the keys are therefore twain,</p>
		<p>The which my predecessor meanly priz&rsquo;d.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Then, yielding to the forceful arguments,</p>
		<p>Of silence as more perilous I deem&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>And answer&rsquo;d: &ldquo;Father! since thou washest me</p>
		<p>Clear of that guilt wherein I now must fall,</p>
		<p>Large promise with performance scant, be sure,</p>
		<p>Shall make thee triumph in thy lofty seat.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;When I was number&rsquo;d with the dead, then came</p>
		<p>Saint Francis for me; but a cherub dark</p>
		<p>He met, who cried: &lsquo;Wrong me not; he is mine,</p>
		<p>And must below to join the wretched crew,</p>
		<p>For the deceitful counsel which he gave.</p>
		<p>E&rsquo;er since I watch&rsquo;d him, hov&rsquo;ring at his hair,</p>
		<p>No power can the impenitent absolve;</p>
		<p>Nor to repent and will at once consist,</p>
		<p>By contradiction absolute forbid.&rsquo;&nbsp;&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Oh mis&rsquo;ry! how I shook myself, when he</p>
		<p>Seiz&rsquo;d me, and cried, &ldquo;Thou haply thought&rsquo;st me not</p>
		<p>A disputant in logic so exact.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>To Minos down he bore me, and the judge</p>
		<p>Twin&rsquo;d eight times round his callous back the tail,</p>
		<p>Which biting with excess of rage, he spake:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;This is a guilty soul, that in the fire</p>
		<p>Must vanish. Hence perdition-doom&rsquo;d I rove</p>
		<p>A prey to rankling sorrow in this garb.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">When he had thus fulfill&rsquo;d his words, the flame</p>
		<p>In dolour parted, beating to and fro,</p>
		<p>And writhing its sharp horn. We onward went,</p>
		<p>I and my leader, up along the rock,</p>
		<p>Far as another arch, that overhangs</p>

		<p>Tell of the wounds and blood that now I saw,</p>
		<p>Though he repeated oft the tale? No tongue</p>
		<p>So vast a theme could equal, speech and thought</p>
		<p>Both impotent alike. If in one band</p>
		<p>Collected, stood the people all, who e&rsquo;er</p>
		<p>Pour&rsquo;d on Apulia&rsquo;s happy soil their blood,</p>
		<p>Slain by the Trojans, and in that long war</p>
		<p>When of the rings the measur&rsquo;d booty made</p>
		<p>A pile so high, as Rome&rsquo;s historian writes</p>
		<p>Who errs not, with the multitude, that felt</p>
		<p>The grinding force of Guiscard&rsquo;s Norman steel,</p>

		<p>At Ceperano, there where treachery</p>

		<p>Thy walls, O Tagliacozzo, without arms</p>
		<p>The old Alardo conquer&rsquo;d; and his limbs</p>
		<p>One were to show transpierc&rsquo;d, another his</p>
		<p>Clean lopt away; a spectacle like this</p>
		<p>Were but a thing of nought, to the&rsquo; hideous sight</p>
		<p>Of the ninth chasm. A rundlet, that hath lost</p>
		<p>Its middle or side stave, gapes not so wide,</p>
		<p>As one I mark&rsquo;d, torn from the chin throughout</p>
		<p>Down to the hinder passage: &rsquo;twixt the legs</p>
		<p>Dangling his entrails hung, the midriff lay</p>
		<p>Open to view, and wretched ventricle,</p>
		<p>That turns th&rsquo; englutted aliment to dross.</p>
		<p class="slindent">Whilst eagerly I fix on him my gaze,</p>
		<p>He ey&rsquo;d me, with his hands laid his breast bare,</p>
		<p>And cried; &ldquo;Now mark how I do rip me! lo!</p>
		<p>&ldquo;How is Mohammed mangled! before me</p>

		<p>Whom here thou seest, while they liv&rsquo;d, did sow</p>
		<p>Scandal and schism, and therefore thus are rent.</p>
		<p>A fiend is here behind, who with his sword</p>
		<p>Hacks us thus cruelly, slivering again</p>
		<p>Each of this ream, when we have compast round</p>
		<p>The dismal way, for first our gashes close</p>
		<p>Ere we repass before him. But say who</p>

		<p>Conduct him. Trust my words, for they are true.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">More than a hundred spirits, when that they heard,</p>
		<p>Stood in the foss to mark me, through amazed,</p>
		<p>Forgetful of their pangs. &ldquo;Thou, who perchance</p>

		<p>No easy conquest else.&rdquo; With foot uprais&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>For stepping, spake Mohammed, on the ground</p>
		<p>Then fix&rsquo;d it to depart. Another shade,</p>
		<p>Pierc&rsquo;d in the throat, his nostrils mutilate</p>
		<p>E&rsquo;en from beneath the eyebrows, and one ear</p>
		<p>Lopt off, who with the rest through wonder stood</p>
		<p>Gazing, before the rest advanc&rsquo;d, and bar&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>His wind-pipe, that without was all o&rsquo;ersmear&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>With crimson stain. &ldquo;O thou!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;whom sin</p>

		<p>Near to Cattolica, through perfidy</p>
		<p>Of a fell tyrant. &rsquo;Twixt the Cyprian isle</p>
		<p>And Balearic, ne&rsquo;er hath Neptune seen</p>

		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Declare, as thou dost wish that I above</p>
		<p>May carry tidings of thee, who is he,</p>
		<p>In whom that sight doth wake such sad remembrance?&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Forthwith he laid his hand on the cheek-bone</p>
		<p>Of one, his fellow-spirit, and his jaws</p>
		<p>Expanding, cried: &ldquo;Lo! this is he I wot of;</p>
		<p>He speaks not for himself: the outcast this</p>
		<p>Who overwhelm&rsquo;d the doubt in Caesar&rsquo;s mind,</p>
		<p>Affirming that delay to men prepar&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Was ever harmful.&rdquo; Oh how terrified</p>
		<p>Methought was Curio, from whose throat was cut</p>
		<p>The tongue, which spake that hardy word. Then one</p>
		<p>Maim&rsquo;d of each hand, uplifted in the gloom</p>
		<p>The bleeding stumps, that they with gory spots</p>
		<p>Sullied his face, and cried: &ldquo;&nbsp;&lsquo;Remember thee</p>
		<p>Of Mosca, too, I who, alas! exclaim&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>&rsquo;The deed once done there is an end,&rsquo; that prov&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>A seed of sorrow to the Tuscan race.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">I added: &ldquo;Ay, and death to thine own tribe.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Whence heaping woe on woe he hurried off,</p>
		<p>As one grief stung to madness. But I there</p>
		<p>Still linger&rsquo;d to behold the troop, and saw</p>
		<p>Things, such as I may fear without more proof</p>
		<p>To tell of, but that conscience makes me firm,</p>
		<p>The boon companion, who her strong breast-plate</p>
		<p>Buckles on him, that feels no guilt within</p>
		<p>And bids him on and fear not. Without doubt</p>
		<p>I saw, and yet it seems to pass before me,</p>
		<p>A headless trunk, that even as the rest</p>
		<p>Of the sad flock pac&rsquo;d onward. By the hair</p>
		<p>It bore the sever&rsquo;d member, lantern-wise</p>
		<p>Pendent in hand, which look&rsquo;d at us and said,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Woe&rsquo;s me!&rdquo; The spirit lighted thus himself,</p>
		<p>And two there were in one, and one in two.</p>
		<p>How that may be he knows who ordereth so.</p>
		<p class="slindent">When at the bridge&rsquo;s foot direct he stood,</p>
		<p>His arm aloft he rear&rsquo;d, thrusting the head</p>
		<p>Full in our view, that nearer we might hear</p>
		<p>The words, which thus it utter&rsquo;d: &ldquo;Now behold</p>
		<p>This grievous torment, thou, who breathing go&rsquo;st</p>
		<p>To spy the dead; behold if any else</p>
		<p>Be terrible as this. And that on earth</p>
		<p>Thou mayst bear tidings of me, know that I</p>
		<p>Am Bertrand, he of Born, who gave King John</p>
		<p>The counsel mischievous. Father and son</p>
		<p>I set at mutual war. For Absalom</p>
		<p>And David more did not Ahitophel,</p>
		<p>Spurring them on maliciously to strife.</p>
		<p>For parting those so closely knit, my brain</p>
		<p>Parted, alas! I carry from its source,</p>

		<p>Wert busied with his spirit, who once rul&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>The towers of Hautefort, that thou lookedst not</p>
		<p>That way, ere he was gone.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;O guide belov&rsquo;d!</p>
		<p>His violent death yet unaveng&rsquo;d,&rdquo; said I,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;By any, who are partners in his shame,</p>
		<p>Made him contemptuous: therefore, as I think,</p>
		<p>He pass&rsquo;d me speechless by; and doing so</p>
		<p>Hath made me more compassionate his fate.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">So we discours&rsquo;d to where the rock first show&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>The other valley, had more light been there,</p>
		<p>E&rsquo;en to the lowest depth. Soon as we came</p>
		<p>O&rsquo;er the last cloister in the dismal rounds</p>
		<p>Of Malebolge, and the brotherhood</p>
		<p>Were to our view expos&rsquo;d, then many a dart</p>
		<p>Of sore lament assail&rsquo;d me, headed all</p>
		<p>With points of thrilling pity, that I clos&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Both ears against the volley with mine hands.</p>
		<p class="slindent">As were the torment, if each lazar-house</p>
		<p>Of Valdichiana, in the sultry time</p>
		<p>&rsquo;Twixt July and September, with the isle</p>
		<p>Sardinia and Maremma&rsquo;s pestilent fen,</p>
		<p>Had heap&rsquo;d their maladies all in one foss</p>
		<p>Together; such was here the torment: dire</p>
		<p>The stench, as issuing steams from fester&rsquo;d limbs.</p>
		<p class="slindent">We on the utmost shore of the long rock</p>
		<p>Descended still to leftward. Then my sight</p>
		<p>Was livelier to explore the depth, wherein</p>
		<p>The minister of the most mighty Lord,</p>
		<p>All-searching Justice, dooms to punishment</p>
		<p>The forgers noted on her dread record.</p>
		<p class="slindent">More rueful was it not methinks to see</p>
		<p>The nation in Aegina droop, what time</p>
		<p>Each living thing, e&rsquo;en to the little worm,</p>
		<p>All fell, so full of malice was the air</p>
		<p>(And afterward, as bards of yore have told,</p>
		<p>The ancient people were restor&rsquo;d anew</p>
		<p>From seed of emmets) than was here to see</p>
		<p>The spirits, that languish&rsquo;d through the murky vale</p>
		<p>Up-pil&rsquo;d on many a stack. Confus&rsquo;d they lay,</p>
		<p>One o&rsquo;er the belly, o&rsquo;er the shoulders one</p>
		<p>Roll&rsquo;d of another; sideling crawl&rsquo;d a third</p>
		<p>Along the dismal pathway. Step by step</p>
		<p>We journey&rsquo;d on, in silence looking round</p>
		<p>And list&rsquo;ning those diseas&rsquo;d, who strove in vain</p>
		<p>To lift their forms. Then two I mark&rsquo;d, that sat</p>
		<p>Propp&rsquo;d &rsquo;gainst each other, as two brazen pans</p>
		<p>Set to retain the heat. From head to foot,</p>
		<p>A tetter bark&rsquo;d them round. Nor saw I e&rsquo;er</p>
		<p>Groom currying so fast, for whom his lord</p>
		<p>Impatient waited, or himself perchance</p>
		<p>Tir&rsquo;d with long watching, as of these each one</p>
		<p>Plied quickly his keen nails, through furiousness</p>
		<p>Of ne&rsquo;er abated pruriency. The crust</p>
		<p>Came drawn from underneath in flakes, like scales</p>
		<p>Scrap&rsquo;d from the bream or fish of broader mail.</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;O thou, who with thy fingers rendest off</p>
		<p>Thy coat of proof,&rdquo; thus spake my guide to one,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;And sometimes makest tearing pincers of them,</p>
		<p>Tell me if any born of Latian land</p>
		<p>Be among these within: so may thy nails</p>
		<p>Serve thee for everlasting to this toil.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Both are of Latium,&rdquo; weeping he replied,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Whom tortur&rsquo;d thus thou seest: but who art thou</p>
		<p>That hast inquir&rsquo;d of us?&rdquo; To whom my guide:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;One that descend with this man, who yet lives,</p>
		<p>From rock to rock, and show him hell&rsquo;s abyss.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Then started they asunder, and each turn&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Trembling toward us, with the rest, whose ear</p>
		<p>Those words redounding struck. To me my liege</p>
		<p>Address&rsquo;d him: &ldquo;Speak to them whate&rsquo;er thou list.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">And I therewith began: &ldquo;So may no time</p>
		<p>Filch your remembrance from the thoughts of men</p>
		<p>In th&rsquo; upper world, but after many suns</p>
		<p>Survive it, as ye tell me, who ye are,</p>
		<p>And of what race ye come. Your punishment,</p>
		<p>Unseemly and disgustful in its kind,</p>
		<p>Deter you not from opening thus much to me.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Arezzo was my dwelling,&rdquo; answer&rsquo;d one,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;And me Albero of Sienna brought</p>
		<p>To die by fire; but that, for which I died,</p>
		<p>Leads me not here. True is in sport I told him,</p>
		<p>That I had learn&rsquo;d to wing my flight in air.</p>
		<p>And he admiring much, as he was void</p>
		<p>Of wisdom, will&rsquo;d me to declare to him</p>
		<p>The secret of mine art: and only hence,</p>
		<p>Because I made him not a Daedalus,</p>
		<p>Prevail&rsquo;d on one suppos&rsquo;d his sire to burn me.</p>
		<p>But Minos to this chasm last of the ten,</p>
		<p>For that I practis&rsquo;d alchemy on earth,</p>
		<p>Has doom&rsquo;d me. Him no subterfuge eludes.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Then to the bard I spake: &ldquo;Was ever race</p>
		<p>Light as Sienna&rsquo;s? Sure not France herself</p>
		<p>Can show a tribe so frivolous and vain.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">The other leprous spirit heard my words,</p>
		<p>And thus return&rsquo;d: &ldquo;Be Stricca from this charge</p>
		<p>Exempted, he who knew so temp&rsquo;rately</p>
		<p>To lay out fortune&rsquo;s gifts; and Niccolo</p>
		<p>Who first the spice&rsquo;s costly luxury</p>
		<p>Discover&rsquo;d in that garden, where such seed</p>
		<p>Roots deepest in the soil: and be that troop</p>
		<p>Exempted, with whom Caccia of Asciano</p>
		<p>Lavish&rsquo;d his vineyards and wide-spreading woods,</p>
		<p>And his rare wisdom Abbagliato show&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>A spectacle for all. That thou mayst know</p>
		<p>Who seconds thee against the Siennese</p>
		<p>Thus gladly, bend this way thy sharpen&rsquo;d sight,</p>
		<p>That well my face may answer to thy ken;</p>
		<p>So shalt thou see I am Capocchio&rsquo;s ghost,</p>
		<p>Who forg&rsquo;d transmuted metals by the power</p>
		<p>Of alchemy; and if I scan thee right,</p>
		<p>Thus needs must well remember how I aped</p>
		<p>Creative nature by my subtle art.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>With such fell cruelty were seen, their goads</p>
		<p>Infixing in the limbs of man or beast,</p>
		<p>As now two pale and naked ghost I saw</p>
		<p>That gnarling wildly scamper&rsquo;d, like the swine</p>

		<p>Be patient to inform us, who it is,</p>

		<p>For his own share, the lady of the herd.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">When vanish&rsquo;d the two furious shades, on whom</p>
		<p>Mine eye was held, I turn&rsquo;d it back to view</p>
		<p>The other cursed spirits. One I saw</p>
		<p>In fashion like a lute, had but the groin</p>
		<p>Been sever&rsquo;d, where it meets the forked part.</p>
		<p>Swoln dropsy, disproportioning the limbs</p>

		<p>Suits not the visage, open&rsquo;d wide his lips</p>
		<p>Gasping as in the hectic man for drought,</p>
		<p>One towards the chin, the other upward curl&rsquo;d.</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;O ye, who in this world of misery,</p>
		<p>Wherefore I know not, are exempt from pain,&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Thus he began, &ldquo;attentively regard</p>

		<p>Ne&rsquo;er lack&rsquo;d me of what most I coveted;</p>
		<p>One drop of water now, alas! I crave.</p>
		<p>The rills, that glitter down the grassy slopes</p>
		<p>Of Casentino, making fresh and soft</p>
		<p>The banks whereby they glide to Arno&rsquo;s stream,</p>
		<p>Stand ever in my view; and not in vain;</p>
		<p>For more the pictur&rsquo;d semblance dries me up,</p>
		<p>Much more than the disease, which makes the flesh</p>

		<p>Where I transgress&rsquo;d, stern justice urging me,</p>
		<p>Takes means to quicken more my lab&rsquo;ring sighs.</p>
		<p>There is Romena, where I falsified</p>
		<p>The metal with the Baptist&rsquo;s form imprest,</p>
		<p>For which on earth I left my body burnt.</p>
		<p>But if I here might see the sorrowing soul</p>
		<p>Of Guido, Alessandro, or their brother,</p>
		<p>For Branda&rsquo;s limpid spring I would not change</p>
		<p>The welcome sight. One is e&rsquo;en now within,</p>
		<p>If truly the mad spirits tell, that round</p>
		<p>Are wand&rsquo;ring. But wherein besteads me that?</p>
		<p>My limbs are fetter&rsquo;d. Were I but so light,</p>
		<p>That I each hundred years might move one inch,</p>
		<p>I had set forth already on this path,</p>
		<p>Seeking him out amidst the shapeless crew,</p>
		<p>Although eleven miles it wind, not more</p>
		<p>Than half of one across. They brought me down</p>
		<p>Among this tribe; induc&rsquo;d by them I stamp&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>The florens with three carats of alloy.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Who are that abject pair,&rdquo; I next inquir&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;That closely bounding thee upon thy right</p>
		<p>Lie smoking, like a band in winter steep&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>In the chill stream?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;When to this gulf I dropt,&rdquo;</p>
		<p>He answer&rsquo;d, &ldquo;here I found them; since that hour</p>
		<p>They have not turn&rsquo;d, nor ever shall, I ween,</p>
		<p>Till time hath run his course. One is that dame</p>

		<p>Sinon the other, that false Greek from Troy.</p>
		<p>Sharp fever drains the reeky moistness out,</p>
		<p>In such a cloud upsteam&rsquo;d.&rdquo; When that he heard,</p>
		<p>One, gall&rsquo;d perchance to be so darkly nam&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>With clench&rsquo;d hand smote him on the braced paunch,</p>
		<p>That like a drum resounded: but forthwith</p>
		<p>Adamo smote him on the face, the blow</p>
		<p>Returning with his arm, that seem&rsquo;d as hard.</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Though my o&rsquo;erweighty limbs have ta&rsquo;en from me</p>

		<p>At liberty for such employ.&rdquo; To whom</p>
		<p>Was answer&rsquo;d: &ldquo;When thou wentest to the fire,</p>
		<p>Thou hadst it not so ready at command,</p>
		<p>Then readier when it coin&rsquo;d th&rsquo; impostor gold.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">And thus the dropsied: &ldquo;Ay, now speak&rsquo;st thou true.</p>
		<p>But there thou gav&rsquo;st not such true testimony,</p>
		<p>When thou wast question&rsquo;d of the truth, at Troy.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;If I spake false, thou falsely stamp&rsquo;dst the coin,&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Said Sinon; &ldquo;I am here but for one fault,</p>
		<p>And thou for more than any imp beside.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Remember,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;O perjur&rsquo;d one,</p>
		<p>The horse remember, that did teem with death,</p>
		<p>And all the world be witness to thy guilt.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;To thine,&rdquo; return&rsquo;d the Greek, &ldquo;witness the thirst</p>
		<p>Whence thy tongue cracks, witness the fluid mound,</p>
		<p>Rear&rsquo;d by thy belly up before thine eyes,</p>
		<p>A mass corrupt.&rdquo; To whom the coiner thus:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Thy mouth gapes wide as ever to let pass</p>
		<p>Its evil saying. Me if thirst assails,</p>
		<p>Yet I am stuff&rsquo;d with moisture. Thou art parch&rsquo;d,</p>

		<p>To make thee lap Narcissus&rsquo; mirror up.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">I was all fix&rsquo;d to listen, when my guide</p>
		<p>Admonish&rsquo;d: &ldquo;Now beware: a little more.</p>
		<p>And I do quarrel with thee.&rdquo; I perceiv&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>How angrily he spake, and towards him turn&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>With shame so poignant, as remember&rsquo;d yet</p>
		<p>Confounds me. As a man that dreams of harm</p>
		<p>Befall&rsquo;n him, dreaming wishes it a dream,</p>
		<p>And that which is, desires as if it were not,</p>
		<p>Such then was I, who wanting power to speak</p>
		<p>Wish&rsquo;d to excuse myself, and all the while</p>
		<p>Excus&rsquo;d me, though unweeting that I did.</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;More grievous fault than thine has been, less shame,&rdquo;</p>
		<p>My master cried, &ldquo;might expiate. Therefore cast</p>
		<p>All sorrow from thy soul; and if again</p>

		<p><span class="sc">The</span> very tongue, whose keen reproof before</p>

		<p>Achilles and his father&rsquo;s javelin caus&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Pain first, and then the boon of health restor&rsquo;d.</p>
		<p class="slindent">Turning our back upon the vale of woe,</p>
		<p>W cross&rsquo;d th&rsquo; encircled mound in silence. There</p>
		<p>Was twilight dim, that far long the gloom</p>
		<p>Mine eye advanc&rsquo;d not: but I heard a horn</p>
		<p>Sounded aloud. The peal it blew had made</p>
		<p>The thunder feeble. Following its course</p>
		<p>The adverse way, my strained eyes were bent</p>
		<p>On that one spot. So terrible a blast</p>
		<p>Orlando blew not, when that dismal rout</p>
		<p>O&rsquo;erthrew the host of Charlemagne, and quench&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>His saintly warfare. Thitherward not long</p>
		<p>My head was rais&rsquo;d, when many lofty towers</p>
		<p>Methought I spied. &ldquo;Master,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what land</p>
		<p>Is this?&rdquo; He answer&rsquo;d straight: &ldquo;Too long a space</p>
		<p>Of intervening darkness has thine eye</p>

		<p>In thy imagining. Thither arriv&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Thou well shalt see, how distance can delude</p>
		<p>The sense. A little therefore urge thee on.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Then tenderly he caught me by the hand;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Yet know,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;ere farther we advance,</p>
		<p>That it less strange may seem, these are not towers,</p>
		<p>But giants. In the pit they stand immers&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Each from his navel downward, round the bank.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">As when a fog disperseth gradually,</p>
		<p>Our vision traces what the mist involves</p>
		<p>Condens&rsquo;d in air; so piercing through the gross</p>
		<p>And gloomy atmosphere, as more and more</p>
		<p>We near&rsquo;d toward the brink, mine error fled,</p>
		<p>And fear came o&rsquo;er me. As with circling round</p>
		<p>Of turrets, Montereggion crowns his walls,</p>
		<p>E&rsquo;en thus the shore, encompassing th&rsquo; abyss,</p>
		<p>Was turreted with giants, half their length</p>
		<p>Uprearing, horrible, whom Jove from heav&rsquo;n</p>
		<p>Yet threatens, when his mutt&rsquo;ring thunder rolls.</p>
		<p class="slindent">Of one already I descried the face,</p>
		<p>Shoulders, and breast, and of the belly huge</p>
		<p>Great part, and both arms down along his ribs.</p>
		<p class="slindent">All-teeming nature, when her plastic hand</p>
		<p>Left framing of these monsters, did display</p>
		<p>Past doubt her wisdom, taking from mad War</p>
		<p>Such slaves to do his bidding; and if she</p>
		<p>Repent her not of th&rsquo; elephant and whale,</p>
		<p>Who ponders well confesses her therein</p>
		<p>Wiser and more discreet; for when brute force</p>
		<p>And evil will are back&rsquo;d with subtlety,</p>
		<p>Resistance none avails. His visage seem&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>In length and bulk, as doth the pine, that tops</p>
		<p>Saint Peter&rsquo;s Roman fane; and th&rsquo; other bones</p>
		<p>Of like proportion, so that from above</p>
		<p>The bank, which girdled him below, such height</p>
		<p>Arose his stature, that three Friezelanders</p>
		<p>Had striv&rsquo;n in vain to reach but to his hair.</p>
		<p>Full thirty ample palms was he expos&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Downward from whence a man his garments loops.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Raphel bai ameth sabi almi,&rdquo;</p>
		<p>So shouted his fierce lips, which sweeter hymns</p>
		<p>Became not; and my guide address&rsquo;d him thus:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;O senseless spirit! let thy horn for thee</p>
		<p>Interpret: therewith vent thy rage, if rage</p>
		<p>Or other passion wring thee. Search thy neck,</p>
		<p>There shalt thou find the belt that binds it on.</p>
		<p>Wild spirit! lo, upon thy mighty breast</p>
		<p>Where hangs the baldrick!&rdquo; Then to me he spake:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;He doth accuse himself. Nimrod is this,</p>
		<p>Through whose ill counsel in the world no more</p>
		<p>One tongue prevails. But pass we on, nor waste</p>
		<p>Our words; for so each language is to him,</p>
		<p>As his to others, understood by none.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Then to the leftward turning sped we forth,</p>
		<p>And at a sling&rsquo;s throw found another shade</p>
		<p>Far fiercer and more huge. I cannot say</p>
		<p>What master hand had girt him; but he held</p>
		<p>Behind the right arm fetter&rsquo;d, and before</p>
		<p>The other with a chain, that fasten&rsquo;d him</p>
		<p>From the neck down, and five times round his form</p>
		<p>Apparent met the wreathed links. &ldquo;This proud one</p>
		<p>Would of his strength against almighty Jove</p>
		<p>Make trial,&rdquo; said my guide; &ldquo;whence he is thus</p>
		<p>Requited: Ephialtes him they call.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Great was his prowess, when the giants brought</p>
		<p>Fear on the gods: those arms, which then he piled,</p>
		<p>Now moves he never.&rdquo; Forthwith I return&rsquo;d:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Fain would I, if &rsquo;t were possible, mine eyes</p>
		<p>Of Briareus immeasurable gain&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Experience next.&rdquo; He answer&rsquo;d: &ldquo;Thou shalt see</p>
		<p>Not far from hence Antaeus, who both speaks</p>
		<p>And is unfetter&rsquo;d, who shall place us there</p>
		<p>Where guilt is at its depth. Far onward stands</p>
		<p>Whom thou wouldst fain behold, in chains, and made</p>
		<p>Like to this spirit, save that in his looks</p>
		<p>More fell he seems.&rdquo; By violent earthquake rock&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Ne&rsquo;er shook a tow&rsquo;r, so reeling to its base,</p>
		<p>As Ephialtes. More than ever then</p>
		<p>I dreaded death, nor than the terror more</p>
		<p>Had needed, if I had not seen the cords</p>
		<p>That held him fast. We, straightway journeying on,</p>
		<p>Came to Antaeus, who five ells complete</p>
		<p>Without the head, forth issued from the cave.</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;O thou, who in the fortunate vale, that made</p>

		<p>And caught my guide. Alcides whilom felt</p>
		<p>That grapple straighten&rsquo;d score. Soon as my guide</p>
		<p>Had felt it, he bespake me thus: &ldquo;This way</p>
		<p>That I may clasp thee;&rdquo; then so caught me up,</p>
		<p>That we were both one burden. As appears</p>
		<p>The tower of Carisenda, from beneath</p>
		<p>Where it doth lean, if chance a passing cloud</p>
		<p>So sail across, that opposite it hangs,</p>
		<p>Such then Antaeus seem&rsquo;d, as at mine ease</p>
		<p>I mark&rsquo;d him stooping. I were fain at times</p>
		<p>T&rsquo; have pass&rsquo;d another way. Yet in th&rsquo; abyss,</p>
		<p>That Lucifer with Judas low ingulfs,</p>
		<p>Lightly he plac&rsquo;d us; nor there leaning stay&rsquo;d,</p>

		<p>Beyond all others wretched! who abide</p>
		<p>In such a mansion, as scarce thought finds words</p>
		<p>To speak of, better had ye here on earth</p>

		<p>Still on the lofty battlement, a voice</p>
		<p>Bespoke me thus: &ldquo;Look how thou walkest. Take</p>

		<p>And saw before and underneath my feet</p>
		<p>A lake, whose frozen surface liker seem&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>To glass than water. Not so thick a veil</p>
		<p>In winter e&rsquo;er hath Austrian Danube spread</p>
		<p>O&rsquo;er his still course, nor Tanais far remote</p>

		<p>Not e&rsquo;en its rim had creak&rsquo;d. As peeps the frog</p>
		<p>Croaking above the wave, what time in dreams</p>
		<p>The village gleaner oft pursues her toil,</p>
		<p>So, to where modest shame appears, thus low</p>
		<p>Blue pinch&rsquo;d and shrin&rsquo;d in ice the spirits stood,</p>
		<p>Moving their teeth in shrill note like the stork.</p>
		<p>His face each downward held; their mouth the cold,</p>
		<p>Their eyes express&rsquo;d the dolour of their heart.</p>
		<p class="slindent">A space I look&rsquo;d around, then at my feet</p>
		<p>Saw two so strictly join&rsquo;d, that of their head</p>
		<p>The very hairs were mingled. &ldquo;Tell me ye,</p>

		<p>The tears betwixt those orbs and held them there.</p>
		<p>Plank unto plank hath never cramp clos&rsquo;d up</p>
		<p>So stoutly. Whence like two enraged goats</p>
		<p>They clash&rsquo;d together; them such fury seiz&rsquo;d.</p>
		<p class="slindent">And one, from whom the cold both ears had reft,</p>
		<p>Exclaim&rsquo;d, still looking downward: &ldquo;Why on us</p>
		<p>Dost speculate so long? If thou wouldst know</p>
		<p>Who are these two, the valley, whence his wave</p>
		<p>Bisenzio slopes, did for its master own</p>
		<p>Their sire Alberto, and next him themselves.</p>
		<p>They from one body issued; and throughout</p>
		<p>Caina thou mayst search, nor find a shade</p>
		<p>More worthy in congealment to be fix&rsquo;d,</p>

		<p>At that one blow dissever&rsquo;d, not Focaccia,</p>
		<p>No not this spirit, whose o&rsquo;erjutting head</p>
		<p>Obstructs my onward view: he bore the name</p>

		<p>Had shap&rsquo;d into a doggish grin; whence creeps</p>
		<p>A shiv&rsquo;ring horror o&rsquo;er me, at the thought</p>
		<p>Of those frore shallows. While we journey&rsquo;d on</p>
		<p>Toward the middle, at whose point unites</p>
		<p>All heavy substance, and I trembling went</p>
		<p>Through that eternal chillness, I know not</p>
		<p>If will it were or destiny, or chance,</p>
		<p>But, passing &rsquo;midst the heads, my foot did strike</p>
		<p>With violent blow against the face of one.</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Wherefore dost bruise me?&rdquo; weeping, he exclaim&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Unless thy errand be some fresh revenge</p>

		<p>Still curs&rsquo;d me in his wrath. &ldquo;What art thou, speak,</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Now who art thou, that smiting others&rsquo; cheeks</p>
		<p>Through Antenora roamest, with such force</p>
		<p>As were past suff&rsquo;rance, wert thou living still?&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;And I am living, to thy joy perchance,&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Was my reply, &ldquo;if fame be dear to thee,</p>
		<p>That with the rest I may thy name enrol.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;The contrary of what I covet most,&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Said he, &ldquo;thou tender&rsquo;st: hence; nor vex me more.</p>
		<p>Ill knowest thou to flatter in this vale.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Then seizing on his hinder scalp, I cried:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Name thee, or not a hair shall tarry here.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Rend all away,&rdquo; he answer&rsquo;d, &ldquo;yet for that</p>
		<p>I will not tell nor show thee who I am,</p>
		<p>Though at my head thou pluck a thousand times.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Now I had grasp&rsquo;d his tresses, and stript off</p>
		<p>More than one tuft, he barking, with his eyes</p>
		<p>Drawn in and downward, when another cried,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;What ails thee, Bocca? Sound not loud enough</p>
		<p>Thy chatt&rsquo;ring teeth, but thou must bark outright?</p>
		<p>What devil wrings thee?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;be dumb,</p>

		<p>When I do hear thee. Know I was on earth</p>

		<p>Ruggieri. Why I neighbour him so close,</p>

		<p>What therefore thou canst not have heard, that is,</p>
		<p>How cruel was the murder, shalt thou hear,</p>
		<p>And know if he have wrong&rsquo;d me. A small grate</p>
		<p>Within that mew, which for my sake the name</p>
		<p>Of famine bears, where others yet must pine,</p>
		<p>Already through its opening sev&rsquo;ral moons</p>
		<p>Had shown me, when I slept the evil sleep,</p>
		<p>That from the future tore the curtain off.</p>
		<p>This one, methought, as master of the sport,</p>
		<p>Rode forth to chase the gaunt wolf and his whelps</p>
		<p>Unto the mountain, which forbids the sight</p>
		<p>Of Lucca to the Pisan. With lean brachs</p>
		<p>Inquisitive and keen, before him rang&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Lanfranchi with Sismondi and Gualandi.</p>
		<p>After short course the father and the sons</p>
		<p>Seem&rsquo;d tir&rsquo;d and lagging, and methought I saw</p>
		<p>The sharp tusks gore their sides. When I awoke</p>
		<p>Before the dawn, amid their sleep I heard</p>
		<p>My sons (for they were with me) weep and ask</p>
		<p>For bread. Right cruel art thou, if no pang</p>
		<p>Thou feel at thinking what my heart foretold;</p>
		<p>And if not now, why use thy tears to flow?</p>
		<p>Now had they waken&rsquo;d; and the hour drew near</p>
		<p>When they were wont to bring us food; the mind</p>
		<p>Of each misgave him through his dream, and I</p>
		<p>Heard, at its outlet underneath lock&rsquo;d up</p>
		<p>The&rsquo; horrible tower: whence uttering not a word</p>
		<p>I look&rsquo;d upon the visage of my sons.</p>
		<p>I wept not: so all stone I felt within.</p>
		<p>They wept: and one, my little Anslem, cried:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Thou lookest so! Father what ails thee?&rdquo; Yet</p>
		<p>I shed no tear, nor answer&rsquo;d all that day</p>
		<p>Nor the next night, until another sun</p>
		<p>Came out upon the world. When a faint beam</p>
		<p>Had to our doleful prison made its way,</p>
		<p>And in four countenances I descry&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>The image of my own, on either hand</p>
		<p>Through agony I bit, and they who thought</p>
		<p>I did it through desire of feeding, rose</p>
		<p>O&rsquo; th&rsquo; sudden, and cried, &lsquo;Father, we should grieve</p>
		<p>Far less, if thou wouldst eat of us: thou gav&rsquo;st</p>
		<p>These weeds of miserable flesh we wear,</p>
		<p>&rsquo;And do thou strip them off from us again.&rsquo;</p>
		<p>Then, not to make them sadder, I kept down</p>
		<p>My spirit in stillness. That day and the next</p>
		<p>We all were silent. Ah, obdurate earth!</p>
		<p>Why open&rsquo;dst not upon us? When we came</p>
		<p>To the fourth day, then Geddo at my feet</p>
		<p>Outstretch&rsquo;d did fling him, crying, &lsquo;Hast no help</p>
		<p>For me, my father!&rsquo; There he died, and e&rsquo;en</p>
		<p>Plainly as thou seest me, saw I the three</p>
		<p>Fall one by one &rsquo;twixt the fifth day and sixth:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Whence I betook me now grown blind to grope</p>
		<p>Over them all, and for three days aloud</p>
		<p>Call&rsquo;d on them who were dead. Then fasting got</p>
		<p>The mastery of grief.&rdquo; Thus having spoke,</p>
		<p>Once more upon the wretched skull his teeth</p>
		<p>He fasten&rsquo;d, like a mastiff&rsquo;s &rsquo;gainst the bone</p>
		<p>Firm and unyielding. Oh thou Pisa! shame</p>
		<p>Of all the people, who their dwelling make</p>
		<p>In that fair region, where th&rsquo; Italian voice</p>
		<p>Is heard, since that thy neighbours are so slack</p>
		<p>To punish, from their deep foundations rise</p>
		<p>Capraia and Gorgona, and dam up</p>
		<p>The mouth of Arno, that each soul in thee</p>
		<p>May perish in the waters! What if fame</p>
		<p>Reported that thy castles were betray&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>By Ugolino, yet no right hadst thou</p>
		<p>To stretch his children on the rack. For them,</p>
		<p>Brigata, Ugaccione, and the pair</p>
		<p>Of gentle ones, of whom my song hath told,</p>
		<p>Their tender years, thou modern Thebes! did make</p>
		<p>Uncapable of guilt. Onward we pass&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Where others skarf&rsquo;d in rugged folds of ice</p>
		<p>Not on their feet were turn&rsquo;d, but each revers&rsquo;d.</p>
		<p class="slindent">There very weeping suffers not to weep;</p>
		<p>For at their eyes grief seeking passage finds</p>
		<p>Impediment, and rolling inward turns</p>
		<p>For increase of sharp anguish: the first tears</p>
		<p>Hang cluster&rsquo;d, and like crystal vizors show,</p>
		<p>Under the socket brimming all the cup.</p>
		<p class="slindent">Now though the cold had from my face dislodg&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Each feeling, as &rsquo;t were callous, yet me seem&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Some breath of wind I felt. &ldquo;Whence cometh this,&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Said I, &ldquo;my master? Is not here below</p>
		<p>All vapour quench&rsquo;d?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Thou shalt be speedily,&rdquo;</p>
		<p>He answer&rsquo;d, &ldquo;where thine eye shall tell thee whence</p>
		<p>The cause descrying of this airy shower.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">Then cried out one in the chill crust who mourn&rsquo;d:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;O souls so cruel! that the farthest post</p>
		<p>Hath been assign&rsquo;d you, from this face remove</p>
		<p>The harden&rsquo;d veil, that I may vent the grief</p>
		<p>Impregnate at my heart, some little space</p>
		<p>Ere it congeal again!&rdquo; I thus replied:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Say who thou wast, if thou wouldst have mine aid;</p>
		<p>And if I extricate thee not, far down</p>
		<p>As to the lowest ice may I descend!&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;The friar Alberigo,&rdquo; answered he,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Am I, who from the evil garden pluck&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Its fruitage, and am here repaid, the date</p>
		<p>More luscious for my fig.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Hah!&rdquo; I exclaim&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Art thou too dead!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;How in the world aloft</p>
		<p>It fareth with my body,&rdquo; answer&rsquo;d he,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I am right ignorant. Such privilege</p>

		<p>The glazed tear-drops that o&rsquo;erlay mine eyes,</p>
		<p>Know that the soul, that moment she betrays,</p>
		<p>As I did, yields her body to a fiend</p>
		<p>Who after moves and governs it at will,</p>
		<p>Till all its time be rounded; headlong she</p>
		<p>Falls to this cistern. And perchance above</p>
		<p>Doth yet appear the body of a ghost,</p>
		<p>Who here behind me winters. Him thou know&rsquo;st,</p>
		<p>If thou but newly art arriv&rsquo;d below.</p>
		<p>The years are many that have pass&rsquo;d away,</p>
		<p>Since to this fastness Branca Doria came.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; answer&rsquo;d I, &ldquo;methinks thou mockest me,</p>
		<p>For Branca Doria never yet hath died,</p>
		<p>But doth all natural functions of a man,</p>
		<p>Eats, drinks, and sleeps, and putteth raiment on.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">He thus: &ldquo;Not yet unto that upper foss</p>
		<p>By th&rsquo; evil talons guarded, where the pitch</p>
		<p>Tenacious boils, had Michael Zanche reach&rsquo;d,</p>

		<p>In his own body, and of one his kin,</p>
		<p>Who with him treachery wrought. But now put forth</p>
		<p>Thy hand, and ope mine eyes.&rdquo; I op&rsquo;d them not.</p>
		<p>Ill manners were best courtesy to him.</p>
		<p class="slindent">Ah Genoese! men perverse in every way,</p>
		<p>With every foulness stain&rsquo;d, why from the earth</p>
		<p>Are ye not cancel&rsquo;d? Such an one of yours</p>

		<p>Towards us; therefore look,&rdquo; so spake my guide,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;If thou discern him.&rdquo; As, when breathes a cloud</p>
		<p>Heavy and dense, or when the shades of night</p>
		<p>Fall on our hemisphere, seems view&rsquo;d from far</p>
		<p>A windmill, which the blast stirs briskly round,</p>
		<p>Such was the fabric then methought I saw,</p>
		<p class="slindent">To shield me from the wind, forthwith I drew</p>
		<p>Behind my guide: no covert else was there.</p>
		<p class="slindent">Now came I (and with fear I bid my strain</p>
		<p>Record the marvel) where the souls were all</p>
		<p>Whelm&rsquo;d underneath, transparent, as through glass</p>
		<p>Pellucid the frail stem. Some prone were laid,</p>
		<p>Others stood upright, this upon the soles,</p>
		<p>That on his head, a third with face to feet</p>
		<p>Arch&rsquo;d like a bow. When to the point we came,</p>
		<p>Whereat my guide was pleas&rsquo;d that I should see</p>
		<p>The creature eminent in beauty once,</p>
		<p>He from before me stepp&rsquo;d and made me pause.</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Lo!&rdquo; he exclaim&rsquo;d, &ldquo;lo Dis! and lo the place,</p>
		<p>Where thou hast need to arm thy heart with strength.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">How frozen and how faint I then became,</p>
		<p>Ask me not, reader! for I write it not,</p>
		<p>Since words would fail to tell thee of my state.</p>
		<p>I was not dead nor living. Think thyself</p>
		<p>If quick conception work in thee at all,</p>
		<p>How I did feel. That emperor, who sways</p>
		<p>The realm of sorrow, at mid breast from th&rsquo; ice</p>
		<p>Stood forth; and I in stature am more like</p>
		<p>A giant, than the giants are in his arms.</p>
		<p>Mark now how great that whole must be, which suits</p>
		<p>With such a part. If he were beautiful</p>
		<p>As he is hideous now, and yet did dare</p>
		<p>To scowl upon his Maker, well from him</p>
		<p>May all our mis&rsquo;ry flow. Oh what a sight!</p>
		<p>How passing strange it seem&rsquo;d, when I did spy</p>
		<p>Upon his head three faces: one in front</p>
		<p>Of hue vermilion, th&rsquo; other two with this</p>
		<p>Midway each shoulder join&rsquo;d and at the crest;</p>
		<p>The right &rsquo;twixt wan and yellow seem&rsquo;d: the left</p>
		<p>To look on, such as come from whence old Nile</p>
		<p>Stoops to the lowlands. Under each shot forth</p>
		<p>Two mighty wings, enormous as became</p>
		<p>A bird so vast. Sails never such I saw</p>
		<p>Outstretch&rsquo;d on the wide sea. No plumes had they,</p>
		<p>But were in texture like a bat, and these</p>
		<p>He flapp&rsquo;d i&rsquo; th&rsquo; air, that from him issued still</p>
		<p>Three winds, wherewith Cocytus to its depth</p>
		<p>Was frozen. At six eyes he wept: the tears</p>
		<p>Adown three chins distill&rsquo;d with bloody foam.</p>
		<p>At every mouth his teeth a sinner champ&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Bruis&rsquo;d as with pond&rsquo;rous engine, so that three</p>
		<p>Were in this guise tormented. But far more</p>
		<p>Than from that gnawing, was the foremost pang&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>By the fierce rending, whence ofttimes the back</p>
		<p>Was stript of all its skin. &ldquo;That upper spirit,</p>
		<p>Who hath worse punishment,&rdquo; so spake my guide,</p>

		<p>And speaks not! Th&rsquo; other Cassius, that appears</p>
		<p>So large of limb. But night now re-ascends,</p>
		<p>And it is time for parting. All is seen.&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">I clipp&rsquo;d him round the neck, for so he bade;</p>
		<p>And noting time and place, he, when the wings</p>
		<p>Enough were op&rsquo;d, caught fast the shaggy sides,</p>
		<p>And down from pile to pile descending stepp&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Between the thick fell and the jagged ice.</p>
		<p class="slindent">Soon as he reach&rsquo;d the point, whereat the thigh</p>
		<p>Upon the swelling of the haunches turns,</p>
		<p>My leader there with pain and struggling hard</p>
		<p>Turn&rsquo;d round his head, where his feet stood before,</p>
		<p>And grappled at the fell, as one who mounts,</p>
		<p>That into hell methought we turn&rsquo;d again.</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Expect that by such stairs as these,&rdquo; thus spake</p>
		<p>The teacher, panting like a man forespent,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We must depart from evil so extreme.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Then at a rocky opening issued forth,</p>
		<p>And plac&rsquo;d me on a brink to sit, next join&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>With wary step my side. I rais&rsquo;d mine eyes,</p>
		<p>Believing that I Lucifer should see</p>
		<p>Where he was lately left, but saw him now</p>
		<p>With legs held upward. Let the grosser sort,</p>
		<p>Who see not what the point was I had pass&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Bethink them if sore toil oppress&rsquo;d me then.</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Arise,&rdquo; my master cried, &ldquo;upon thy feet.</p>
		<p>The way is long, and much uncouth the road;</p>
		<p>And now within one hour and half of noon</p>
		<p>The sun returns.&rdquo; It was no palace-hall</p>
		<p>Lofty and luminous wherein we stood,</p>
		<p>But natural dungeon where ill footing was</p>
		<p>And scant supply of light. &ldquo;Ere from th&rsquo; abyss</p>
		<p>I sep&rsquo;rate,&rdquo; thus when risen I began,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;My guide! vouchsafe few words to set me free</p>
		<p>From error&rsquo;s thralldom. Where is now the ice?</p>
		<p>How standeth he in posture thus revers&rsquo;d?</p>
		<p>And how from eve to morn in space so brief</p>
		<p>Hath the sun made his transit?&rdquo; He in few</p>
		<p>Thus answering spake: &ldquo;Thou deemest thou art still</p>
		<p>On th&rsquo; other side the centre, where I grasp&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Th&rsquo; abhorred worm, that boreth through the world.</p>
		<p>Thou wast on th&rsquo; other side, so long as I</p>
		<p>Descended; when I turn&rsquo;d, thou didst o&rsquo;erpass</p>
		<p>That point, to which from ev&rsquo;ry part is dragg&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>All heavy substance. Thou art now arriv&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Under the hemisphere opposed to that,</p>
		<p>Which the great continent doth overspread,</p>
		<p>And underneath whose canopy expir&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>The Man, that was born sinless, and so liv&rsquo;d.</p>
		<p>Thy feet are planted on the smallest sphere,</p>
		<p>Whose other aspect is Judecca. Morn</p>
		<p>Here rises, when there evening sets: and he,</p>
		<p>Whose shaggy pile was scal&rsquo;d, yet standeth fix&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>As at the first. On this part he fell down</p>
		<p>From heav&rsquo;n; and th&rsquo; earth, here prominent before,</p>
		<p>Through fear of him did veil her with the sea,</p>
		<p>And to our hemisphere retir&rsquo;d. Perchance</p>
		<p>To shun him was the vacant space left here</p>
		<p>By what of firm land on this side appears,</p>
		<p>That sprang aloof.&rdquo; There is a place beneath,</p>
		<p>From Belzebub as distant, as extends</p>
		<p>The vaulted tomb, discover&rsquo;d not by sight,</p>
		<p>But by the sound of brooklet, that descends</p>
		<p>This way along the hollow of a rock,</p>
		<p>Which, as it winds with no precipitous course,</p>
		<p>The wave hath eaten. By that hidden way</p>
		<p>My guide and I did enter, to return</p>
		<p>To the fair world: and heedless of repose</p>
		<p>We climbed, he first, I following his steps,</p>
		<p>Till on our view the beautiful lights of heav&rsquo;n</p>
		<p>Dawn&rsquo;d through a circular opening in the cave:</p>
		<p>Thus issuing we again beheld the stars.</p>

CANTO XI

v. 9. Pope Anastasius.] The commentators are not agreed concerning the identity of the person, who is here mentioned as a follower of the heretical Photinus. By some he is supposed to have been Anastasius the Second, by others, the Fourth of that name; while a third set, jealous of the integrity of the papal faith, contend that our poet has confounded him with Anastasius 1. Emperor of the East.

v. 17. My son.] The remainder of the present Canto may be considered as a syllabus of the whole of this part of the poem.

v. 48. And sorrows.] This fine moral, that not to enjoy our being is to be ungrateful to the Author of it, is well expressed in Spenser, F. Q. b. iv. c. viii. st. 15. For he whose daies in wilful woe are worne The grace of his Creator doth despise, That will not use his gifts for thankless nigardise.

v. 53. Cahors.] A city in Guienne, much frequented by usurers

v. 83. Thy ethic page.] He refers to Aristotle's Ethics.

[GREEK HERE]

"In the next place, entering, on another division of the subject, let it be defined. that respecting morals there are three sorts of things to be avoided, malice, incontinence, and brutishness."

        As when some vig'rous youth with sharpen'd axe
        A pastur'd bullock smites behind the horns
        And hews the muscle through; he, at the stroke
        Springs forth and falls.
               Cowper's Translation.
v. 36. He arriv'd.] Our Saviour, who, according to Dante, when he ascended from hell, carried with him the souls of the patriarchs, and other just men, out of the first circle. See Canto IV.

v. 96. Nessus.] Our poet was probably induced, by the following
line in Ovid, to assign to Nessus the task of conducting them
over the ford:
        Nessus edit membrisque valens scitusque vadorum.
        Metam, l. ix.
And Ovid's authority was Sophocles, who says of this Centaur—
[GREEK HERE] Trach.570
        He in his arms, Evenus' stream
        Deep flowing, bore the passenger for hire
        Without or sail or billow cleaving oar.
v. 110. Ezzolino.] Ezzolino, or Azzolino di Romano, a most cruel tyrant in the Marca Trivigiana, Lord of Padua, Vicenza, Verona, and Brescia, who died in 1260. His atrocities form the subject of a Latin tragedy, called Eccerinis, by Albertino Mussato, of Padua, the contemporary of Dante, and the most elegant writer of Latin verse of that age. See also the Paradise, Canto IX. Berni Orl. Inn. l ii c. xxv. st. 50. Ariosto. Orl. Fur. c. iii. st. 33. and Tassoni Secchia Rapita, c. viii. st 11.

v. 111. Obizzo' of Este.] Marquis of Ferrara and of the Marca d'Ancona, was murdered by his own son (whom, for the most unnatural act Dante calls his step-son), for the sake of the treasures which his rapacity had amassed. See Ariosto. Orl. Fur. c. iii. st 32. He died in 1293 according to Gibbon. Ant. of the House of Brunswick. Posth. Works, v. ii. 4to.

v. 119. He.] "Henrie, the brother of this Edmund, and son to the foresaid king of Almaine (Richard, brother of Henry III. of England) as he returned from Affrike, where he had been with Prince Edward, was slain at Viterbo in Italy (whither he was come about business which he had to do with the Pope) by the hand of Guy de Montfort, the son of Simon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, in revenge of the same Simon's death. The murther was committed afore the high altar, as the same Henrie kneeled there to hear divine service." A.D. 1272, Holinshed's chronicles p 275. See also Giov. Villani Hist. I. vii. c. 40.

        Pazzo the other named.]
Two noted marauders, by whose depredations the public ways in
Italy were infested. The latter was of the noble family of Pazzi
in Florence.
CANTO XIII

v. 10. Betwixt Corneto and Cecina's stream.] A wild and woody tract of country, abounding in deer, goats, and wild boars. Cecina is a river not far to the south of Leghorn, Corneto, a small city on the same coast in the patrimony of the church.

v. 12. The Strophades.] See Virg. Aen. l. iii. 210.

v. 14. Broad are their pennons.] From Virg. Aen. l. iii. 216.

v. 48. In my verse described.] The commentators explain this, "If he could have believed, in consequence of my assurances alone, that of which he hath now had ocular proof, he would not have stretched forth his hand against thee." But I am of opinion that Dante makes Virgil allude to his own story of Polydorus in the third book of the Aeneid.

v. 56. That pleasant word of thine.] "Since you have inveigled me to speak my holding forth so gratifying an expectation, let it not displease you if I am as it were detained in the snare you have spread for me, so as to be somewhat prolix in my answer."

v. 60. I it was.] Pietro delle Vigne, a native of Capua, who, from a low condition, raised himself by his eloquence and legal knowledge to the office of Chancellor to the Emperor Frederick II. whose confidence in him was such, that his influence in the empire became unbounded. The courtiers, envious of his exalted situation, contrived, by means of forged letters, to make Frederick believe that he held a secret and traitorous intercourse with the Pope, who was then at enmity with the Emperor. In consequence of this supposed crime he was cruelly condemned by his too credulous sovereign to lose his eyes, and, being driven to despair by his unmerited calamity and disgrace, he put an end to his life by dashing out his brains against the walls of a church, in the year 1245. Both Frederick and Pietro delle Vigne composed verses in the Sicilian dialect which are yet extant.

v. 67. The harlot.] Envy. Chaucer alludes to this in the
Prologue to the Legende of Good women.
        Envie is lavender to the court alway,
        For she ne parteth neither night ne day
        Out of the house of Cesar; thus saith Dant.
v. 119. Each fan o' th' wood.] Hence perhaps Milton:
        Leaves and fuming rills, Aurora's fan.
               P. L. b. v. 6.
v. 122. Lano.] Lano, a Siennese, who, being reduced by prodigality to a state of extreme want, found his existence no longer supportable; and, having been sent by his countrymen on a military expedition, to assist the Florentine against the Aretini, took that opportunity of exposing himself to certain death, in the engagement which took place at Toppo near Arezzo. See G. Villani, Hist. l. 7. c. cxix.

v. 133. O Giocomo Of Sant' Andrea!] Jacopo da Sant' Andrea, a Paduan, who, having wasted his property in the most wanton acts of profusion, killed himself in despair. v. 144. In that City.] "I was an inhabitant of Florence, that city which changed her first patron Mars for St. John the Baptist, for which reason the vengeance of the deity thus slighted will never be appeased: and, if some remains of his status were not still visible on the bridge over the Arno, she would have been already leveled to the ground; and thus the citizens, who raised her again from the ashes to which Attila had reduced her, would have laboured in vain." See Paradise, Canto XVI. 44. The relic of antiquity to which the superstition of Florence attached so high an importance, was carried away by a flood, that destroyed the bridge on which it stood, in the year 1337, but without the ill effects that were apprehended from the loss of their fancied Palladium.

v. 152. I slung the fatal noose.] We are not informed who this suicide was.

CANTO XIV

v. 28. As, in the torrid Indian clime.] Landino refers to Albertus Magnus for the circumstance here alluded to.

v. 53. In Mongibello.]
        More hot than Aetn' or flaming Mongibell.
               Spenser, F. Q. b. ii. c. ix. st. 29.
See Virg. Aen. 1. viii. 416. and Berni. Orl. Inn 1. i. c. xvi.

Greek writers.
v. 64. This of the seven kings was one.] Compare Aesch. Seven Chiefs, 425. Euripides, Phoen. 1179 and Statius. Theb. l. x. 821.

v. 76. Bulicame.] A warm medicinal spring near Viterbo, the waters of which, as Landino and Vellutelli affirm, passed by a place of ill fame. Venturi, with less probability, conjectures that Dante would imply, that it was the scene of much licentious merriment among those who frequented its baths.

v. 91. Under whose monarch.]
        Credo pudicitiam Saturno rege moratam
        In terris.
               Juv. Satir. vi.
v. 102. His head.] Daniel, ch. ii. 32, 33.

v. 133. Whither.] On the other side of Purgatory.

CANTO XV

v. 10. Chiarentana.] A part of the Alps where the Brenta rises, which river is much swoln as soon as the snow begins to dissolve on the mountains.

v. 28. Brunetto.] "Ser Brunetto, a Florentine, the secretary or chancellor of the city, and Dante's preceptor, hath left us a work so little read, that both the subject of it and the language of it have been mistaken. It is in the French spoken in the reign of St. Louis,under the title of Tresor, and contains a species of philosophical course of lectures divided into theory and practice, or, as he expresses it, "un enchaussement des choses divines et humaines," &c. Sir R. Clayton's Translation of Tenhove's Memoirs of the Medici, vol. i. ch. ii. p. 104. The Tresor has never been printed in the original language. There is a fine manuscript of it in the British Museum, with an illuminated portrait of Brunetto in his study prefixed. Mus. Brit. MSS. 17, E. 1. Tesor. It is divided into four books, the first, on Cosmogony and Theology, the second, a translation of Aristotle's Ethics; the third on Virtues and Vices; the fourth, on Rhetoric. For an interesting memoir relating to this work, see Hist. de l'Acad. des Inscriptions, tom. vii. 296. His Tesoretto, one of the earliest productions of Italian poetry, is a curious work, not unlike the writings of Chaucer in style and numbers, though Bembo remarks, that his pupil, however largely he had stolen from it, could not have much enriched himself. As it is perhaps but little known, I will here add a slight sketch of it.

Brunetto describes himself as returning from an embassy to the King of Spain, on which he had been sent by the Guelph party from Florence. On the plain of Roncesvalles he meets a scholar on a bay mule, who tells him that the Guelfi are driven out of the city with great loss.

Struck with grief at these mournful tidings, and musing with his head bent downwards, he loses his road, and wanders into a wood. Here Nature, whose figure is described with sublimity, appears, and discloses to him the secrets of her operations. After this he wanders into a desert; but at length proceeds on his way, under the protection of a banner, with which Nature had furnished him, till on the third day he finds himself in a large pleasant champaign, where are assembled many emperors, kings, and sages. It is the habitation of Virtue and her daughters, the four Cardinal Virtues. Here Brunetto sees also Courtesy, Bounty, Loyalty, and Prowess, and hears the instructions they give to a knight, which occupy about a fourth part of the poem. Leaving this territory, he passes over valleys, mountains, woods, forests, and bridges, till he arrives in a beautiful valley covered with flowers on all sides, and the richest in the world; but which was continually shifting its appearance from a round figure to a square, from obscurity to light, and from populousness to solitude. This is the region of Pleasure, or Cupid, who is accompanied by four ladies, Love, Hope, Fear, and Desire. In one part of it he meets with Ovid, and is instructed by him how to conquer the passion of love, and to escape from that place. After his escape he makes his confession to a friar, and then returns to the forest of visions: and ascending a mountain, he meets with Ptolemy, a venerable old man. Here the narrative breaks off. The poem ends, as it began, with an address to Rustico di Filippo, on whom he lavishes every sort of praise.

It has been observed, that Dante derived the idea of opening his poem by describing himself as lost in a wood, from the Tesoretto of his master. I know not whether it has been remarked, that the crime of usury is branded by both these poets as offensive to God and Nature: or that the sin for which Brunetto is condemned by his pupil, is mentioned in the Tesoretto with great horror. Dante's twenty-fifth sonnet is a jocose one, addressed to Brunetto. He died in 1295.

v. 62. Who in old times came down from Fesole.] See G. Villani Hist. l. iv. c. 5. and Macchiavelli Hist. of Flor. b. ii.

v. 89. With another text.] He refers to the prediction of Farinata, in Canto X.

v. 110. Priscian.] There is no reason to believe, as the commentators observe that the grammarian of this name was stained with the vice imputed to him; and we must therefore suppose that Dante puts the individual for the species, and implies the frequency of the crime among those who abused the opportunities which the education of youth afforded them, to so abominable a purpose.

v. 111. Francesco.] Son of Accorso, a Florentine, celebrated for his skill in jurisprudence, and commonly known by the name of Accursius.

v. 113. Him.] Andrea de' Mozzi, who, that his scandalous life might be less exposed to observation, was translated either by Nicholas III, or Boniface VIII from the see of Florence to that of Vicenza, through which passes the river Baccchiglione. At the latter of these places he died.

v. 114. The servants' servant.] Servo de' servi. So Ariosto,
Sat. 3.
               Degli servi
        Io sia il gran servo.
v. 124. I commend my Treasure to thee.] Brunetto's great work,
the Tresor.
Sieti raccomandato 'l mio Tesoro.
So Giusto de' Conti, in his Bella Mano, Son. "Occhi:"
        Siavi raccommandato il mio Tesoro.
CANTO XVI

v. 38. Gualdrada.] Gualdrada was the daughter of Bellincione Berti, of whom mention is made in the Paradise, Canto XV, and XVI. He was of the family of Ravignani, a branch of the Adimari.

The Emperor Otho IV. being at a festival in Florence, where Gualdrada was present, was struck with her beauty; and inquiring who she was, was answered by Bellincione, that she was the daughter of one who, if it was his Majesty's pleasure, would make her admit the honour of his salute. On overhearing this, she arose from her seat, and blushing, in an animated tone of voice, desired her father that he would not be so liberal in his offers, for that no man should ever be allowed that freedom, except him who should be her lawful husband. The Emperor was not less delighted by her resolute modesty than he had before been by the loveliness of her person, and calling to him Guido, one of his barons, gave her to him in marriage, at the same time raising him

to the rank of a count, and bestowing on her the whole of Casentino, and a part of the territory of Romagna, as her portion. Two sons were the offspring of this union, Guglielmo and Ruggieri, the latter of whom was father of Guidoguerra, a man of great military skill and prowess who, at the head of four hundred Florentines of the Guelph party, was signally instrumental to the victory obtained at Benevento by Charles of Anjou, over Manfredi, King of Naples, in 1265. One of the consequences of this victory was the expulsion of the Ghibellini, and the re-establishment of the Guelfi at Florence.

v. 39. Many a noble act.] Compare Tasso, G. L. c. i. st. 1.

v. 42. Aldobrandiu] Tegghiaio Aldobrandi was of the noble family of Adimari, and much esteemed for his military talents. He endeavored to dissuade the Florentines from the attack, which they meditated against the Siennese, and the rejection of his counsel occasioned the memorable defeat, which the former sustained at Montaperto, and the consequent banishment of the Guelfi from Florence.

v. 45. Rusticucci.] Giacopo Rusticucci, a Florentine, remarkable for his opulence and the generosity of his spirit.

v. 70. Borsiere.] Guglielmo Borsiere, another Florentine, whom Boccaccio, in a story which he relates of him, terms "a man of courteous and elegant manners, and of great readiness in conversation." Dec. Giorn. i. Nov. 8.

v. 84. When thou with pleasure shalt retrace the past.]
        Quando ti giovera dicere io fui.
So Tasso, G. L. c. xv. st. 38.
        Quando mi giovera narrar altrui
        Le novita vedute, e dire; io fui.
v. 121. Ever to that truth.] This memorable apophthegm is repeated by Luigi Pulci and Trissino.

        Sempre a quel ver, ch' ha faccia di menzogna
        E piu senno tacer la lingua cheta
        Che spesso senza colpa fa vergogna.
               Morgante. Magg. c. xxiv.
               La verita, che par mensogna
        Si dovrebbe tacer dall' uom ch'e saggio.
               Italia. Lib. C. xvi.
CANTO XVII

v. 1. The fell monster.] Fraud.

v. 53. A pouch.] A purse, whereon the armorial bearings of each were emblazoned. According to Landino, our poet implies that the usurer can pretend to no other honour, than such as he derives from his purse and his family.

v. 57. A yellow purse.] The arms of the Gianfigliazzi of Florence.

v. 60. Another.] Those of the Ubbriachi, another Florentine family of high distinction.

v. 62. A fat and azure swine.] The arms of the Scrovigni a noble family of Padua.

v. 66. Vitaliano.] Vitaliano del Dente, a Paduan.

v. 69. That noble knight.] Giovanni Bujamonti, a Florentine usurer, the most infamous of his time.

CANTO XVIII

v. 28. With us beyond.] Beyond the middle point they tended the same way with us, but their pace was quicker than ours.

v. 29. E'en thus the Romans.] In the year 1300, Pope Boniface VIII., to remedy the inconvenience occasioned by the press of people who were passing over the bridge of St. Angelo during the time of the Jubilee, caused it to be divided length wise by a partition, and ordered, that all those who were going to St. Peter's should keep one side, and those returning the other.

v. 50. Venedico.] Venedico Caccianimico, a Bolognese, who prevailed on his sister Ghisola to prostitute herself to Obizzo da Este, Marquis of Ferrara, whom we have seen among the tyrants, Canto XII.

v. 62. To answer Sipa.] He denotes Bologna by its situation between the rivers Savena to the east, and Reno to the west of that city; and by a peculiarity of dialect, the use of the affirmative sipa instead of si.

v. 90. Hypsipyle.] See Appolonius Rhodius, l. i. and Valerius Flaccus l.ii. Hypsipyle deceived the other women by concealing her father Thoas, when they had agreed to put all their males to death.

v. 120. Alessio.] Alessio, of an ancient and considerable family in Lucca, called the Interminei.

v. 130. Thais.] He alludes to that passage in the Eunuchus of Terence where Thraso asks if Thais was obliged to him for the present he had sent her, and Gnatho replies, that she had expressed her obligation in the most forcible terms. T. Magnas vero agere gratias Thais mihi? G. Ingentes. Eun. a. iii. s. i.

CANTO XIX

v. 18. Saint John's fair dome.] The apertures in the rock were of the same dimensions as the fonts of St. John the Baptist at Florence, one of which, Dante says he had broken, to rescue a child that was playing near and fell in. He intimates that the motive of his breaking the font had been maliciously represented by his enemies.

v. 55. O Boniface!] The spirit mistakes Dante for Boniface VIII. who was then alive, and who he did not expect would have arrived so soon, in consequence, as it should seem, of a prophecy, which predicted the death of that Pope at a later period. Boniface died in 1303.

v. 58. In guile.] "Thou didst presume to arrive by fraudulent means at the papal power, and afterwards to abuse it."

v. 71. In the mighty mantle I was rob'd.] Nicholas III, of the Orsini family, whom the poet therefore calls "figliuol dell' orsa," "son of the she-bear." He died in 1281.

v. 86. From forth the west, a shepherd without law.] Bertrand de Got Archbishop of Bordeaux, who succeeded to the pontificate in 1305, and assumed the title of Clement V. He transferred the holy see to Avignon in 1308 (where it remained till 1376), and died in 1314.

v. 88. A new Jason.] See Maccabees, b. ii. c. iv. 7,8.

v. 97. Nor Peter.] Acts of the Apostles, c.i. 26.

v. 100. The condemned soul.] Judas.

v. 103. Against Charles.] Nicholas III. was enraged against Charles I, King of Sicily, because he rejected with scorn a proposition made by that Pope for an alliance between their families. See G. Villani, Hist. l. vii. c. liv.

v. 109. Th' Evangelist.] Rev. c. xvii. 1, 2, 3. Compare Petrarch. Opera fol. ed. Basil. 1551. Epist. sine titulo liber. ep. xvi. p. 729.

v. 118. Ah, Constantine.] He alludes to the pretended gift of the Lateran by Constantine to Silvester, of which Dante himself seems to imply a doubt, in his treatise "De Monarchia." - "Ergo scindere Imperium, Imperatori non licet. Si ergo aliquae, dignitates per Constantinum essent alienatae, (ut dicunt) ab Imperio," &c. l. iii. The gift is by Ariosto very humorously placed in the moon, among the things lost or abused on earth. Di varj fiori, &c. O. F. c. xxxiv. st. 80.

Milton has translated both this passage and that in the text.
Prose works, vol. i. p. 11. ed. 1753.
CANTO XX

v. 11. Revers'd.] Compare Spenser, F. Q. b. i. c. viii. st. 31

v. 30. Before whose eyes.] Amphiaraus, one of the seven kings who besieged Thebes. He is said to have been swallowed up by an opening of the earth. See Lidgate's Storie of Thebes, Part III where it is told how the "Bishop Amphiaraus" fell down to hell. And thus the devill for his outrages, Like his desert payed him his wages. A different reason for his being doomed thus to perish is assigned by Pindar. [GREEK HERE] Nem ix.

        For thee, Amphiaraus, earth,
        By Jove's all-riving thunder cleft
        Her mighty bosom open'd wide,
        Thee and thy plunging steeds to hide,
        Or ever on thy back the spear
        Of Periclymenus impress'd
        A wound to shame thy warlike breast
        For struck with panic fear
        The gods' own children flee.
v. 37. Tiresias.]
        Duo magnorum viridi coeuntia sylva
        Corpora serpentum baculi violaverat ictu, &c.
               Ovid. Met. iii.
v. 43. Aruns.] Aruns is said to have dwelt in the mountains of Luni (from whence that territory is still called Lunigiana), above Carrara, celebrated for its marble. Lucan. Phars. l. i. 575. So Boccaccio in the Fiammetta, l. iii. "Quale Arunte," &c.

"Like Aruns, who amidst the white marbles of Luni, contemplated the celestial bodies and their motions."

v. 50. Manto.] The daughter of Tiresias of Thebes, a city dedicated to Bacchus. From Manto Mantua, the country of Virgil derives its name. The Poet proceeds to describe the situation of that place.

v. 61. Between the vale.] The lake Benacus, now called the Lago di Garda, though here said to lie between Garda, Val Camonica, and the Apennine, is, however, very distant from the latter two

v. 63. There is a spot.] Prato di Fame, where the dioceses of Trento, Verona, and Brescia met.

v. 69. Peschiera.] A garrison situated to the south of the lake, where it empties itself and forms the Mincius.

v. 94. Casalodi's madness.] Alberto da Casalodi, who had got possession of Mantua, was persuaded by Pinamonte Buonacossi, that he might ingratiate himself with the people by banishing to their

own castles the nobles, who were obnoxious to them. No sooner was this done, than Pinamonte put himself at the head of the populace, drove out Casalodi and his adherents, and obtained the sovereignty for himself.

v. 111. So sings my tragic strain.]
        Suspensi Eurypilum scitatum oracula Phoebi
        Mittimus.
               Virg. Aeneid. ii. 14.
v. 115. Michael Scot.] Sir Michael Scott, of Balwearie, astrologer to the Emperor Frederick II. lived in the thirteenth century. For further particulars relating to this singular man, see Warton's History of English Poetry, vol. i. diss. ii. and sect. ix. p 292, and the Notes to Mr. Scott's "Lay of the Last Minstrel," a poem in which a happy use is made of the traditions that are still current in North Britain concerning him. He is mentioned by G. Villani. Hist. l. x. c. cv. and cxli. and l. xii. c. xviii. and by Boccaccio, Dec. Giorn. viii. Nov. 9.

v. 116. Guido Bonatti.] An astrologer of Forli, on whose skill Guido da Montefeltro, lord of that place, so much relied, that he is reported never to have gone into battle, except in the hour recommended to him as fortunate by Bonatti.

Landino and Vellutello, speak of a book, which he composed on the subject of his art.

v. 116. Asdente.] A shoemaker at Parma, who deserted his business to practice the arts of divination.

v. 123. Cain with fork of thorns.] By Cain and the thorns, or what is still vulgarly called the Man in the Moon, the Poet denotes that luminary. The same superstition is alluded to in the Paradise, Canto II. 52. The curious reader may consult Brand on Popular Antiquities, 4to. 1813. vol. ii. p. 476.

CANTO XXI

v. 7. In the Venetians' arsenal.] Compare Ruccellai, Le Api, 165, and Dryden's Annus Mirabilis, st. 146, &c.

v. 37. One of Santa Zita's elders.] The elders or chief magistrates of Lucca, where Santa Zita was held in especial veneration. The name of this sinner is supposed to have been Martino Botaio.

v. 40. Except Bonturo, barterers.] This is said ironically of Bonturo de' Dati. By barterers are meant peculators, of every description; all who traffic the interests of the public for their own private advantage.

v. 48. Is other swimming than in Serchio's wave.]
        Qui si nuota altrimenti che nel Serchio.
Serchio is the river that flows by Lucca. So Pulci, Morg. Mag.
c. xxiv.
        Qui si nuota nel sangue, e non nel Serchio.
v. 92. From Caprona.] The surrender of the castle of Caprona to the combined forces of Florence and Lucca, on condition that the garrison should march out in safety, to which event Dante was a witness, took place in 1290. See G. Villani, Hist. l. vii. c. 136.

v. 109. Yesterday.] This passage fixes the era of Dante's descent at Good Friday, in the year 1300 (34 years from our blessed Lord's incarnation being added to 1266), and at the thirty-fifth year of our poet's age. See Canto I. v. 1.

The awful event alluded to, the Evangelists inform us, happened "at the ninth hour," that is, our sixth, when "the rocks were rent," and the convulsion, according to Dante, was felt even in the depths in Hell. See Canto XII. 38.

CANTO XXII

v. 16. In the church.] This proverb is repeated by Pulci, Morg. Magg. c. xvii.

v. 47. Born in Navarre's domain.] The name of this peculator is said to have been Ciampolo.

v. 51. The good king Thibault.] "Thibault I. king of Navarre, died on the 8th of June, 1233, as much to be commended for the desire he showed of aiding the war in the Holy Land, as reprehensible and faulty for his design of oppressing the rights and privileges of the church, on which account it is said that the whole kingdom was under an interdict for the space of three entire years. Thibault undoubtedly merits praise, as for his other endowments, so especially for his cultivation of the liberal arts, his exercise and knowledge of music and poetry in which he much excelled, that he was accustomed to compose verses and sing them to the viol, and to exhibit his poetical compositions publicly in his palace, that they might be criticized by all." Mariana, History of Spain, b. xiii. c. 9.

An account of Thibault, and two of his songs, with what were probably the original melodies, may be seen in Dr. Burney's History of Music, v. ii. c. iv. His poems, which are in the French language, were edited by M. l'Eveque de la Ravalliere. Paris. 1742. 2 vol. 12mo. Dante twice quotes one of his verses in the Treatise de Vulg. Eloq. l. i. c. ix. and l. ii. c. v. and refers to him again, l. ii. c. vi.

From "the good king Thibault" are descended the good, but more unfortunate monarch, Louis XVI. of France, and consequently the present legitimate sovereign of that realm. See Henault, Abrege Chron. 1252, 2, 4.

v. 80. The friar Gomita.] He was entrusted by Nino de' Visconti with the government of Gallura, one of the four jurisdictions into which Sardinia was divided. Having his master's enemies in his power, he took a bribe from them, and allowed them to escape. Mention of Nino will recur in the Notes to Canto XXXIII. and in the Purgatory, Canto VIII.

v. 88. Michel Zanche.] The president of Logodoro, another of the four Sardinian jurisdictions. See Canto XXXIII.

CANTO XXIII

v. 5. Aesop's fable.] The fable of the frog, who offered to carry the mouse across a ditch, with the intention of drowning him when both were carried off by a kite. It is not among those Greek Fables which go under the name of Aesop.

v. 63. Monks in Cologne.] They wore their cowls unusually large. v. 66. Frederick's.] The Emperor Frederick II. is said to have punished those who were guilty of high treason, by wrapping them up in lead, and casting them into a furnace.

v. 101. Our bonnets gleaming bright with orange hue.] It is observed by Venturi, that the word "rance" does not here signify "rancid or disgustful," as it is explained by the old commentators, but "orange-coloured," in which sense it occurs in the Purgatory, Canto II. 9.

v. 104. Joyous friars.] "Those who ruled the city of Florence on the part of the Ghibillines, perceiving this discontent and murmuring, which they were fearful might produce a rebellion against themselves, in order to satisfy the people, made choice of two knights, Frati Godenti (joyous friars) of Bologna, on whom they conferred the chief power in Florence. One named M. Catalano de' Malavolti, the other M. Loderingo di Liandolo; one an adherent of the Guelph, the other of the Ghibelline party. It is to be remarked, that the Joyous Friars were called Knights of St. Mary, and became knights on taking that habit: their robes were white, the mantle sable, and the arms a white field and red cross with two stars. Their office was to defend widows and orphans; they were to act as mediators; they had internal regulations like other religious bodies. The above-mentioned M. Loderingo was the founder of that order. But it was not long before they too well deserved the appellation given them, and were found to be more bent on enjoying themselves than on any other subject. These two friars were called in by the Florentines, and had a residence assigned them in the palace belonging to the people over against the Abbey. Such was the dependence placed on the character of their order that it was expected they would be impartial, and would save the commonwealth any unnecessary expense; instead of which, though inclined to opposite parties, they secretly and hypocritically concurred in promoting their own advantage rather than the public good." G. Villani, b. vii. c.13. This happened in 1266.

v. 110. Gardingo's vicinage.] The name of that part of the city which was inhabited by the powerful Ghibelline family of Uberti, and destroyed under the partial and iniquitous administration of Catalano and Loderingo.

v. 117. That pierced spirit.] Caiaphas.

v. 124. The father of his consort.] Annas, father-in-law to Caiaphas.

v. 146. He is a liar.] John, c. viii. 44. Dante had perhaps heard this text from one of the pulpits in Bologna.

CANTO XXIV

v. 1. In the year's early nonage.] "At the latter part of January, when the sun enters into Aquarius, and the equinox is drawing near, when the hoar-frosts in the morning often wear the appearance of snow but are melted by the rising sun."

v. 51. Vanquish thy weariness.]
               Quin corpus onustum
        Hesternis vitiis animum quoque praegravat una,
        Atque affigit humi divinae particulam aurae.
               Hor. Sat. ii. l. ii. 78.
v. 82. Of her sands.] Compare Lucan, Phars. l. ix. 703.

v. 92. Heliotrope.] The occult properties of this stone are described by Solinus, c. xl, and by Boccaccio, in his humorous tale of Calandrino. Decam. G. viii. N. 3.

In Chiabrera's Ruggiero, Scaltrimento begs of Sofia, who is
sending him on a perilous errand, to lend him the heliotrope.
               In mia man fida
        L'elitropia, per cui possa involarmi
        Secondo il mio talento agli occhi altrui.
               c. vi.
        Trust to my hand the heliotrope, by which
        I may at will from others' eyes conceal me
Compare Ariosto, II Negromante, a. 3. s. 3. Pulci, Morg. Magg.
c xxv. and Fortiguerra, Ricciardetto, c. x. st. 17.
Gower in his Confessio Amantis, lib. vii, enumerates it among the
jewels in the diadem of the sun.
        Jaspis and helitropius.
v. 104. The Arabian phoenix.] This is translated from Ovid,
Metam. l. xv.
        Una est quae reparat, seque ipsa reseminat ales,
&c.
See also Petrarch, Canzone:
"Qual piu," &c.

v. 120. Vanni Fucci.] He is said to have been an illegitimate offspring of the family of Lazari in Pistoia, and, having robbed the sacristy of the church of St. James in that city, to have charged Vanni della Nona with the sacrilege, in consequence of which accusation the latter suffered death.

v. 142. Pistoia.] "In May 1301, the Bianchi party, of Pistoia, with the assistance and favor of the Bianchi who ruled Florence, drove out the Neri party from the former place, destroying their houses, Palaces and farms." Giov. Villani, Hist. l. viii. e xliv.

v. 144. From Valdimagra.] The commentators explain this prophetical threat to allude to the victory obtained by the Marquis Marcello Malaspina of Valdimagra (a tract of country now called the Lunigiana) who put himself at the head of the Neri and defeated their opponents the Bianchi, in the Campo Piceno near Pistoia, soon after the occurrence related in the preceding note.

Of this engagement I find no mention in Villani. Currado Malaspina is introduced in the eighth Canto of Purgatory; where it appears that, although on the present occaision they espoused contrary sides, some important favours were nevertheless conferred by that family on our poet at a subsequent perid of his exile in 1307.

Canto XXV

v.1. The sinner ] So Trissino
        Poi facea con le man le fiche al cielo

v. 57. Thus up the shrinking paper.]
        —All my bowels crumble up to dust.

        Upon a parchment; and against this fire
        Do I shrink up.
               Shakespeare, K. John, a. v. s. 7.

v. 77. In that part.] The navel.

v. 81. As if by sleep or fev'rous fit assail'd.]

CANTO XXVI

v. 7. But if our minds.]

        Namque sub Auroram, jam dormitante lucerna,
        Somnia quo cerni tempore vera solent.
               Ovid, Epist. xix
The same poetical superstition is alluded to in the Purgatory,
Cant. IX. and XXVII.
v. 9. Shall feel what Prato.] The poet prognosticates the calamities which were soon to befal his native city, and which he says, even her nearest neighbor, Prato, would wish her. The calamities more particularly pointed at, are said to be the fall of a wooden bridge over the Arno, in May, 1304, where a large multitude were assembled to witness a representation of hell nnd the infernal torments, in consequence of which accident many lives were lost; and a conflagration that in the following month destroyed more than seventeen hundred houses, many ofthem sumptuous buildings. See G. Villani, Hist. l. viii. c. 70 and 71.

v. 22. More than I am wont.] "When I reflect on the punishment allotted to those who do not give sincere and upright advice to others I am more anxious than ever not to abuse to so bad a purpose those talents, whatever they may be, which Nature, or rather Providence, has conferred on me." It is probable that this declaration was the result of real feeling Textd have given great weight to any opinion or party he had espoused, and to whom indigence and exile might have offerred strong temptations to deviate from that line of conduct which a strict sense of duty prescribed.

v. 35. as he, whose wrongs.] Kings, b. ii. c. ii.

v. 54. ascending from that funeral pile.] The flame is said to
have divided on the funeral pile which consumed tile bodies of
Eteocles and Polynices, as if conscious of the enmity that
actuated them while living.
        Ecce iterum fratris, &c.
               Statius, Theb. l. xii.
        Ostendens confectas flamma, &c.
               Lucan, Pharsal. l. 1. 145.
v. 60. The ambush of the horse.] "The ambush of the wooden horse, that caused Aeneas to quit the city of Troy and seek his fortune in Italy, where his descendants founded the Roman empire."

v. 91. Caieta.] Virgil, Aeneid. l. vii. 1.

v. 93. Nor fondness for my son] Imitated hp Tasso, G. L. c.
viii.
        Ne timor di fatica o di periglio,
        Ne vaghezza del regno, ne pietade
        Del vecchio genitor, si degno affetto
        Intiepedir nel generoso petto.
This imagined voyage of Ulysses into the Atlantic is alluded to
by Pulci.
        E sopratutto commendava Ulisse,
        Che per veder nell' altro mondo gisse.
               Morg. Magg. c. xxv
And by Tasso, G. L. c. xv. 25.

CANTO XXVII.

v. 6. The Sicilian Bull.] The engine of torture invented by Perillus, for the tyrant Phalaris.

v. 26. Of the mountains there.] Montefeltro.

v. 38. Polenta's eagle.] Guido Novello da Polenta, who bore an eagle for his coat of arms. The name of Polenta was derived from a castle so called in the neighbourhood of Brittonoro. Cervia is a small maritime city, about fifteen miles to the south of Ravenna. Guido was the son of Ostasio da Polenta, and made himself master of Ravenna, in 1265. In 1322 he was deprived of his sovereignty, and died at Bologna in the year following. This last and most munificent patron of Dante is himself enumerated, by the historian of Italian literature, among the poets of his time. Tiraboschi, Storia della Lett. Ital. t. v. 1. iii. c. ii. 13. The passnge in the text might have removed the uncertainty wwhich Tiraboschi expressed, respecting the duration of Guido's absence from Ravenna, when he was driven from that city in 1295, by the arms of Pietro, archbishop of Monreale. It must evidently have been very short, since his government is here represented (in 1300) as not having suffered any material disturbance for many years.

v. 41. The land.l The territory of Forli, the inhabitants of which, in 1282, mere enabled, hy the strategem of Guido da Montefeltro, who then governed it, to defeat with great slaughter the French army by which it had been besieged. See G. Villani, l. vii. c. 81. The poet informs Guido, its former ruler, that it is now in the possession of Sinibaldo Ordolaffi, or Ardelaffi, whom he designates by his coat of arms, a lion vert.

v. 43. The old mastiff of Verucchio and the young.] Malatesta and Malatestino his son, lords of Rimini, called, from their ferocity, the mastiffs of Verruchio, which was the name of their castle.

v. 50. Whose flank is wash'd of SSavio's wave.] Cesena, situated at the foot of a mountain, and washed by the river Savio, that often descends with a swoln and rapid stream from the Appenine.

v. 64. A man of arms.] Guido da Montefeltro.

v. 68. The high priest.] Boniface VIII.

v. 72. The nature of the lion than the fox.] Non furon leonine ma di volpe. So Pulci, Morg. Magg. c. xix.

        E furon le sua opre e le sue colpe
        Non creder leonine ma di volpe.
v. 81. The chief of the new Pharisee.] Boniface VIII. whose enmity to the family of Colonna prompted him to destroy their houses near the Lateran. Wishing to obtain possession of their other seat, Penestrino, he consulted with Guido da Montefeltro how he might accomplish his purpose, offering him at the same time absolution for his past sins, as well as for that which he was then tempting him to commit. Guido's advice was, that kind words and fair promises nonld put his enemies into his power; and they accordingly soon aftermards fell into the snare laid for them, A.D. 1298. See G. Villani, l. viii. c. 23.

v. 84. Nor against Acre one Had fought.] He alludes to the renegade Christians, by whom the Saracens, in Apri., 1291, were assisted to recover St.John d'Acre, the last possession of the Christians in the Iloly Land. The regret expressed by the Florentine annalist G. Villani, for the loss of this valuable fortress, is well worthy of observation, l. vii. c. 144.

v. 89. As in Soracte Constantine besought.] So in Dante's treatise De Monarchia: "Dicunt quidam adhue, quod Constantinus Imperator, mundatus a lepra intercessione Syvestri, tunc summni pontificis imperii sedem, scilicet Romam, donavit ecclesiae, cum multis allis imperii dignitatibus." Lib.iii.

v. 101. My predecessor.] Celestine V. See Notes to Canto III.

CANTO XXVIII.

v.8. In that long war.] The war of Hannibal in Italy. "When Mago brought news of his victories to Carthage, in order to make his successes more easily credited, he commanded the golden rings to be poured out in the senate house, which made so large a heap, that, as some relate, they filled three modii and a half. A more probable account represents them not to have exceeded one modius." Livy, Hist.

v. 12. Guiscard's Norman steel.] Robert Guiscard, who conquered the kingdom of Naples, and died in 1110. G. Villani, l. iv. c. 18. He is introduced in the Paradise, Canto XVIII.

v. 13. And those the rest.] The army of Manfredi, which, through the treachery of the Apulian troops, wns overcome by Charles of Anjou in 1205, and fell in such numbers that the bones of the slain were still gathered near Ceperano. G. Villani, l. vii. c. 9. See the Purgatory, Canto III.

v. 10. O Tagliocozzo.] He alludes to tile victory which Charles gained over Conradino, by the sage advice of the Sieur de Valeri, in 1208. G. Villani, l. vii. c. 27.

v. 32. Ali.] The disciple of Mohammed.

v. 53. Dolcino.] "In 1305, a friar, called Dolcino, who belonged to no regular order, contrived to raise in Novarra, in Lombardy, a large company of the meaner sort of people, declaring himself to be a true apostle of Christ, and promulgating a community of property and of wives, with many other such heretical doctrines. He blamed the pope, cardinals, and other prelates of the holy church, for not observing their duty, nor leading the angelic life, and affirmed that he ought to be pope. He was followed by more than three thousand men and women, who lived promiscuously on the mountains together, like beasts, and, when they wanted provisions, supplied themselves by depredation and rapine. This lasted for two years till, many being struck with compunction at the dissolute life they led, his sect was much diminished; and through failure of food, and the severity of the snows, he was taken by the people of Novarra, and burnt, with Margarita his companion and many other men and women whom his errors had seduced." G. Villanni, l. viii. c. 84.

Landino observes, that he was possessed of singular eloquence, and that both he and Margarita endored their fate with a firmness worthy of a better cause. For a further account of him, see Muratori Rer. Ital. Script. t. ix. p. 427.

v. 69. Medicina.] A place in the territory of Bologna. Piero fomented dissensions among the inhabitants of that city, and among the leaders of the neighbouring states.

v. 70. The pleasant land.] Lombardy.

v. 72. The twain.] Guido dal Cassero and Angiolello da Cagnano, two of the worthiest and most distinguished citizens of Fano, were invited by Malatestino da Rimini to an entertainment on pretence that he had some important business to transact with them: and, according to instructions given by him, they mere drowned in their passage near Catolica, between Rimini and Fano.

v. 85. Focara's wind.] Focara is a mountain, from which a wind blows that is peculiarly dangerous to the navigators of that coast.

v. 94. The doubt in Caesar's mind.] Curio, whose speech (according to Lucan) determined Julius Caesar to proceed when he had arrived at Rimini (the ancient Ariminum), and doubted whether he should prosecute the civil war. Tolle moras: semper nocuit differre paratis Pharsal, l. i. 281.

v. 102. Mosca.] Buondelmonte was engaged to marry a lady of the Amidei family, but broke his promise and united himself to one of the Donati. This was so much resented by the former, that a meeting of themselves and their kinsmen was held, to consider of the best means of revenging the insult. Mosca degli Uberti persuaded them to resolve on the assassination of Buondelmonte, exclaiming to them "the thing once done, there is an end." The counsel and its effects were the source of many terrible calamities to the state of Florence. "This murder," says G. Villani, l. v. c. 38, "was the cause and beginning of the accursed Guelph and Ghibelline parties in Florence." It happened in 1215. See the Paradise, Canto XVI. 139.

v. 111. The boon companion.] What stronger breastplate than a heart untainted? Shakespeare, 2 Hen. VI. a. iii. s. 2.

v. 160. Bertrand.] Bertrand de Born, Vicomte de Hautefort, near Perigueux in Guienne, who incited John to rebel against his father, Henry II. of England. Bertrand holds a distinguished place among the Provencal poets. He is quoted in Dante, "De Vulg. Eloq." l. ii. c. 2. For the translation of some extracts from his poems, see Millot, Hist. Litteraire des Troubadors t. i. p. 210; but the historical parts of that work are, I believe, not to be relied on.

CANTO XXIX.

v. 26. Geri of Bello.] A kinsman of the Poet's, who was murdered by one of the Sacchetti family. His being placed here, may be considered as a proof that Dante was more impartial in the allotment of his punishments than has generally been supposed.

v. 44. As were the torment.] It is very probable that these
lines gave Milton the idea of his celebrated description:
               Immediately a place
        Before their eyes appear'd, sad, noisome, dark,
        A lasar-house it seem'd, wherein were laid
        Numbers of all diseas'd, all maladies, &c.
               P. L. b. xi. 477.
v. 45. Valdichiana.] The valley through which passes the river Chiana, bounded by Arezzo, Cortona, Montepulciano, and Chiusi. In the heat of autumn it was formerly rendered unwholesome by the stagnation of the water, but has since been drained by the Emperor Leopold II. The Chiana is mentioned as a remarkably sluggish stream, in the Paradise, Canto XIII. 21.

v. 47. Maremma's pestilent fen.] See Note to Canto XXV. v. 18.

v. 58. In Aegina.] He alludes to the fable of the ants changed into Myrmidons. Ovid, Met. 1. vii.

v. 104. Arezzo was my dwelling.] Grifolino of Arezzo, who promised Albero, son of the Bishop of Sienna, that he would teach him the art of flying; and because be did not keep his promise, Albero prevailed on his father to have him burnt for a necromancer.

v. 117.
               Was ever race
        Light as Sienna's?]
The same imputation is again cast on the Siennese, Purg. Canto
XIII. 141.
v. 121. Stricca.] This is said ironically. Stricca, Niccolo Salimbeni, Caccia of Asciano, and Abbagliato, or Meo de Folcacchieri, belonged to a company of prodigal and luxurious young men in Sienna, called the "brigata godereccia." Niccolo was the inventor of a new manner of using cloves in cookery, not very well understood by the commentators, and which was termed the "costuma ricca."

v. 125. In that garden.] Sienna.

v. 134. Cappocchio's ghost.] Capocchio of Sienna, who is said to have been a fellow-student of Dante's in natural philosophy.

CANTO XXX.

v. 4. Athamas.] From Ovid, Metam. 1. iv. Protinos Aelides, &c.

v. 16. Hecuba. See Euripedes, Hecuba; and Ovid, Metnm. l. xiii.

v. 33. Schicchi.] Gianni Schicci, who was of the family of Cavalcanti, possessed such a faculty of moulding his features to the resemblance of others, that he was employed by Simon Donati to personate Buoso Donati, then recently deceased, and to make a will, leaving Simon his heir; for which service he was renumerated with a mare of extraordinary value, here called "the lady of the herd."

v. 39. Myrrha.] See Ovid, Metam. l. x.

v. 60. Adamo's woe.] Adamo of Breschia, at the instigation of Cuido Alessandro, and their brother Aghinulfo, lords of Romena, coonterfeited the coin of Florence; for which crime he was burnt. Landino says, that in his time the peasants still pointed out a pile of stones near Romena as the place of his execution.

v. 64. Casentino.] Romena is a part of Casentino.

v. 77. Branda's limpid spring.] A fountain in Sienna.

v. 88. The florens with three carats of alloy.] The floren was a coin that ought to have had tmenty-four carats of pure gold. Villani relates, that it was first used at Florence in 1253, an aera of great prosperity in the annals of the republic; before which time their most valuable coinage was of silver. Hist. l. vi. c. 54.

v. 98. The false accuser.] Potiphar's wife.

CANTO XXXI.

v. 1. The very tongue.] Vulnus in Herculeo quae quondam fecerat hoste Vulneris auxilium Pellas hasta fuit. Ovid, Rem. Amor. 47. The same allusion was made by Bernard de Ventadour, a Provencal poet in the middle of the twelfth century: and Millot observes, that it was a singular instance of erudition in a Troubadour. But it is not impossible, as Warton remarks, (Hist. of Engl. Poetry, vol. ii. sec. x. p 215.) but that he might have been indebted for it to some of the early romances.

In Chaucer's Squier's Tale, a sword of similar quality is
introduced:
        And other folk have wondred on the sweard,
        That could so piercen through every thing;
        And fell in speech of Telephus the king,
        And of Achillcs for his queint spere,
        For he couth with it both heale and dere.
So Shakspeare, Henry VI. p. ii. a. 5. s. 1.
        Whose smile and frown like to Achilles' spear
        Is able with the change to kill and cure.
v. 14. Orlando.l When Charlemain with all his peerage fell At Fontarabia Milton, P. L. b. i. 586. See Warton's Hist. of Eng. Poetrg, v. i. sect. iii. p. 132. "This is the horn which Orlando won from the giant Jatmund, and which as Turpin and the Islandic bards report, was endued with magical power, and might be heard at the distance of twenty miles." Charlemain and Orlando are introduced in the Paradise, Canto XVIII.

v. 36. Montereggnon.] A castle near Sienna.

v. 105. The fortunate vale.] The country near Carthage. See Liv. Hist. l. xxx. and Lucan, Phars. l. iv. 590. Dante has kept the latter of these writers in his eye throughout all this passage.

v. 123. Alcides.] The combat between Hercules Antaeus is adduced by the Poet in his treatise "De Monarchia," l. ii. as a proof of the judgment of God displayed in the duel, according to the singular superstition of those times.

v. 128. The tower of Carisenda.] The leaning tower at Bologna

CANTO XXXII.

v. 8. A tongue not us'd To infant babbling.] Ne da lingua, che chiami mamma, o babbo. Dante in his treatise " De Vulg. Eloq." speaking of words not admissble in the loftier, or as he calls it, tragic style of poetry, says- "In quorum numero nec puerilia propter suam simplicitatem ut Mamma et Babbo," l. ii. c. vii.

v. 29. Tabernich or Pietrapana.] The one a mountain in Sclavonia, the other in that tract of country called the Garfagnana, not far from Lucca.

v. 33. To where modest shame appears.] "As high as to the face."

v. 35. Moving their teeth in shrill note like the stork.] Mettendo i denti in nota di cicogna. So Boccaccio, G. viii. n. 7. "Lo scolar cattivello quasi cicogna divenuto si forte batteva i denti."

v. 53. Who are these two.] Alessandro and Napoleone, sons of Alberto Alberti, who murdered each other. They were proprietors of the valley of Falterona, where the Bisenzio has its source, a river that falls into the Arno about six miles from Florence.

v. 59. Not him,] Mordrec, son of King Arthur.

v. 60. Foccaccia.] Focaccia of Cancellieri, (the Pistoian family) whose atrocious act of revenge against his uncle is said to have given rise to the parties of the Bianchi and Neri, in the year 1300. See G. Villani, Hist. l, viii. c. 37. and Macchiavelli, Hist. l. ii. The account of the latter writer differs much from that given by Landino in his Commentary.

v. 63. Mascheroni.] Sassol Mascheroni, a Florentiue, who also murdered his uncle.

v. 66. Camiccione.] Camiccione de' Pazzi of Valdarno, by whom his kinsman Ubertino was treacherously pnt to death.

v. 67. Carlino.] One of the same family. He betrayed the Castel di Piano Travigne, in Valdarno, to the Florentines, after the refugees of the Bianca and Ghibelline party had defended it against a siege for twenty-nine days, in the summer of 1302. See G. Villani, l. viii. c. 52 and Dino Compagni, l. ii.

v. 81. Montaperto.] The defeat of the Guelfi at Montaperto, occasioned by the treachery of Bocca degli Abbati, who, during the engagement, cut off the hand of Giacopo del Vacca de'Pazzi, bearer of the Florentine standard. G. Villani, l. vi. c. 80, and Notes to Canto X. This event happened in 1260.

v. 113. Him of Duera.] Buoso of Cremona, of the family of Duera, who was bribed by Guy de Montfort, to leave a pass between Piedmont and Parma, with the defence of which he had been entrusted by the Ghibellines, open to the army of Charles of Anjou, A.D. 1265, at which the people of Cremona were so enraged, that they extirpated the whole family. G. Villani, l. vii. c. 4.

v. 118. Beccaria.] Abbot of Vallombrosa, who was the Pope's Legate at Florence, where his intrigues in favour of the Ghibellines being discovered, he was beheaded. I do not find the occurrence in Vallini, nor do the commentators say to what pope he was legate. By Landino he is reported to have been from Parma, by Vellutello from Pavia.

v. 118. Soldanieri.] "Gianni Soldanieri," says Villani, Hist. l. vii. c14, "put himself at the head of the people, in the hopes of rising into power, not aware that the result would be mischief to the Ghibelline party, and his own ruin; an event which seems ever to have befallen him, who has headed the populace in Florence." A.D. 1266.

v. 119. Ganellon.] The betrayer of Charlemain, mentioned by Archbishop Turpin. He is a common instance of treachery with the poets of the middle ages. Trop son fol e mal pensant, Pis valent que Guenelon. Thibaut, roi de Navarre O new Scariot, and new Ganilion, O false dissembler, &c. Chaucer, Nonne's Prieste's Tale And in the Monke's Tale, Peter of Spaine. v. 119. Tribaldello.] Tribaldello de'Manfredi, who was bribed to betray the city of Faonza, A. D. 1282. G. Villani, l. vii. c. 80

v. 128. Tydeus.] See Statius, Theb. l. viii. ad finem.

CANTO XXXIII.

v. 14. Count Ugolino.] "In the year 1288, in the month of July, Pisa was much divided by competitors for the sovereignty; one party, composed of certain of the Guelphi, being headed by the Judge Nino di Gallura de'Visconti; another, consisting of others of the same faction, by the Count Ugolino de' Gherardeschi; and the third by the Archbishop Ruggieri degli Ubaldini, with the Lanfranchi, Sismondi, Gualandi, and other Ghibelline houses. The Count Ugolino,to effect his purpose, united with the Archbishop and his party, and having betrayed Nino, his sister's son, they contrived that he and his followers should either be driven out of Pisa, or their persons seized. Nino hearing this, and not seeing any means of defending himself, retired to Calci, his castle, and formed an alliance with the Florentines and people of Lucca, against the Pisans. The Count, before Nino was gone, in order to cover his treachery, when everything was settled for his expulsion, quitted Pisa, and repaired to a manor of his called Settimo; whence, as soon as he was informed of Nino's departure, he returned to Pisa with great rejoicing and festivity, and was elevated to the supreme power with every demonstration of triumph and honour. But his greatness was not of long continuauce. It pleased the Almighty that a total reverse of fortune should ensue, as a punishment for his acts of treachery and guilt: for he was said to have poisoned the Count Anselmo da Capraia, his sister's son, on account of the envy and fear excited in his mind by the high esteem in which the gracious manners of Anselmo were held by the Pisans. The power of the Guelphi being so much diminished, the Archbishop devised means to betray the Count Uglino and caused him to be suddenly attacked in his palace by the fury of the people, whom he had exasperated, by telling them that Ugolino had betrayed Pisa, and given up their castles to the citizens of Florence and of Lucca. He was immediately compelled to surrender; his bastard son and his grandson fell in the assault; and two of his sons, with their two sons also, were conveyed to prison." G. Villani l. vii. c. 120.

"In the following march, the Pisans, who had imprisoned the Count Uglino, with two of his sons and two of his grandchildren, the offspring of his son the Count Guelfo, in a tower on the Piazza of the Anzania, caused the tower to be locked, the key thrown into the Arno, and all food to be withheld from them. In a few days they died of hunger; but the Count first with loud cries declared his penitence, and yet neither priest nor friar was allowed to shrive him. All the five, when dead, were dragged out of the prison, and meanly interred; and from thence forward the tower was called the tower of famine, and so shall ever be." Ibid. c. 127.

Chancer has briefly told Ugolino's story. See Monke's Tale,
Hugeline of Pise.
v. 29. Unto the mountain.] The mountain S. Giuliano, between Pisa and Lucca.

v. 59. Thou gav'st.]
               Tu ne vestisti
        Queste misere carni, e tu le spoglia.
Imitated by Filicaja, Canz. iii.
        Di questa imperial caduca spoglia
        Tu, Signor, me vestisti e tu mi spoglia:
        Ben puoi'l Regno me tor tu che me'l desti.
And by Maffei, in the Merope:
               Tu disciogleste
        Queste misere membra e tu le annodi.
v. 79. In that fair region.] Del bel paese la, dove'l si suona. Italy as explained by Dante himself, in his treatise De Vulg. Eloq. l. i. c. 8. "Qui autem Si dicunt a praedictis finibus. (Januensiem) Oreintalem (Meridionalis Europae partem) tenent; videlicet usque ad promontorium illud Italiae, qua sinus Adriatici maris incipit et Siciliam."

v. 82. Capraia and Gorgona.] Small islands near the mouth of the Arno.

v. 94. There very weeping suffers not to weep,] Lo pianto stesso li pianger non lascia. So Giusto de'Conti, Bella Mano. Son. "Quanto il ciel." Che il troppo pianto a me pianger non lassa. v. 116. The friar Albigero.] Alberigo de'Manfredi, of Faenza, one of the Frati Godenti, Joyons Friars who having quarrelled with some of his brotherhood, under pretence of wishing to be reconciled, invited them to a banquet, at the conclusion of which he called for the fruit, a signal for the assassins to rush in and dispatch those whom he had marked for destruction. Hence, adds Landino, it is said proverbially of one who has been stabbed, that he has had some of the friar Alberigo's fruit. Thus Pulci, Morg. Magg. c. xxv. Le frutte amare di frate Alberico.

v. 123. Ptolomea.] This circle is named Ptolomea from Ptolemy, the son of Abubus, by whom Simon and his sons were murdered, at a great banquet he had made for them. See Maccabees, ch xvi.

v. 126. The glazed tear-drops.]

-sorrow's eye, glazed with blinding tears. Shakspeare, Rich. II. a. 2. s. 2.

v. 136. Branca Doria.] The family of Doria was possessed of great influence in Genoa. Branca is said to have murdered his father-in-law, Michel Zanche, introduced in Canto XXII.

v. 162 Romagna's darkest spirit.] The friar Alberigo.

Canto XXXIV.

v. 6. A wind-mill.] The author of the Caliph Vathek, in the notes to that tale, justly observes, that it is more than probable that Don Quixote's mistake of the wind-mills for giants was suggested to Cervantes by this simile.

v. 37. Three faces.] It can scarcely be doubted but that Milton derived his description of Satan in those lines,

               Each passion dimm'd his face
        Thrice chang'd with pale, ire, envy, and despair.
               P. L. b. iv. 114.
from this passage, coupled with the remark of Vellutello upon it:
"The first of these sins is anger which he signifies by the red face; the second, represented by that between pale and yellow is envy and not, as others have said, avarice; and the third, denoted by the black, is a melancholy humour that causes a man's thoughts to be dark and evil, and averse from all joy and tranquillity."

v. 44. Sails.]
               —His sail-broad vans
        He spreads for flight.
               Milton, P. L. b. ii. 927.
Compare Spenser, F. Q. b. i. c. xi. st. 10; Ben Jonson's Every
Man out of his humour, v. 7; and Fletcher's Prophetess, a. 2. s.
3.
v. 46. Like a bat.] The description of an imaginary being, who is called Typhurgo, in the Zodiacus Vitae, has some touches very like this of Dante's Lucifer.

        Ingentem vidi regem ingentique sedentem
        In solio, crines flammanti stemmate cinctum
               —-utrinque patentes
        Alae humeris magnae, quales vespertilionum
        Membranis contextae amplis—
        Nudus erat longis sed opertus corpora villis.
               M. Palingenii, Zod. Vit. l. ix.
        A mighty king I might discerne,
               Plac'd hie on lofty chaire,
        His haire with fyry garland deckt
               Puft up in fiendish wise.
        x x x x x x
               Large wings on him did grow
        Framde like the wings of flinder mice, &c.
               Googe's Translation
v. 61. Brutus.] Landino struggles, but I fear in vain, to extricate Brutus from the unworthy lot which is here assigned him. He maintains, that by Brutus and Cassius are not meant the individuals known by those names, but any who put a lawful monarch to death. Yet if Caesar was such, the conspirators might be regarded as deserving of their doom.

v. 89. Within one hour and half of noon.] The poet uses the Hebrew manner of computing the day, according to which the third hour answers to our twelve o'clock at noon.

v. 120. By what of firm land on this side appears.] The mountain of Purgatory.

v.123. The vaulted tomb.] "La tomba." This word is used to express the whole depth of the infernal region.
