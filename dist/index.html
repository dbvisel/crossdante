			<p>This project is designed to present texts in multiple translations. I wanted to read Dante, but I wasn&rsquo;t sure which translation to read, so I made this so that I could read them all at once.</p>
			<h2>Texts:</h2>
			<p>Choose one to start reading:</p>
			<div class="list">
				<div class="listitem"><span class="linum colored">¶</span><a href="inferno.html">Inferno</a></div>
				<div class="listitem"><span class="linum colored">¶</span><a href="purgatorio.html">Purgatorio</a></div>
				<div class="listitem"><span class="linum colored">¶</span><a href="paradiso.html">Paradiso</a></div>
			</div>
			<h2>How does this work?</h2>
			<div class="list"><div class="listitem"><span class="linum">1.</span>Choose a text.</div>
				<div class="listitem"><span class="linum">2.</span>Change translations by:</div>
					<div class="list"><div class="listitem"><span class="linum colored">¶</span>Using the left and right buttons at the top</div>
						<div class="listitem"><span class="linum colored">¶</span>Using the left and right arrow keys <em>(if you&rsquo;re on a computer)</em></div>
						<div class="listitem"><span class="linum colored">¶</span>Swiping left or right <em>(if you&rsquo;re on a device that allows swiping)</em></div></div>
				<div class="listitem"><span class="linum">3.</span>Change canto by:</div>
					<div class="list"><div class="listitem"><span class="linum colored">¶</span>Using the up and down buttons at the top</div>
						<div class="listitem"><span class="linum colored">¶</span>Using the up and down arrow keys <em>(if you&rsquo;re on a computer)</em></div>
						<div class="listitem"><span class="linum colored">¶</span>Swiping up or down from the bottom or the top of a canto <em>(if you&rsquo;re on a device that allows swiping)</em></div></div>
				<div class="listitem"><span class="linum">4.</span>And if you want to change the set of translations (so you don&rsquo;t see the Italian original, for example), click on the gear at the top to get to the settings page. The settings page also lets you go directly to a specific translation and canto.</div>

			<h2>Why does this exist?</h2>
			<p>Most electronic books are really terrible! Most of the time what people think of when they think about electronic books is something with about the complexity of a Microsoft Word document, a long scroll of text which is hacked into randomly sized pages with capricious formatting. This works for some things; it&rsquo;s terrible for others. But it&rsquo;s cheap and easy to make electronic books like that, so that&rsquo;s what most of them are. That&rsquo;s a shame because we could actually be making things informed by some thought about what the reader is doing when reading, electronic books that actually improve the reading experience.</p>
			<p>I like facing-page translations, especially of poetry: it&rsquo;s nice to move back and forth between an original (even if you only understand a tiny amount of the language) and a translation. It&rsquo;s also nice to compare translations. This is generally a clumsy process with paper books; it&rsquo;s something that can be done relatively easily in an electronic environment if people bothered to try.</p>
			<p>I wanted to make something I could read on my phone with one hand while riding on the subway, like you can with a paperback; and this is the result.</p>
			<h2>Caveats</h2>
			<p>Please note that the translations here aren&rsquo;t being presented as the best available! Rather, they&rsquo;re here by virtue of being in the public domain, which makes it easier to do something like this. In a better world, we&rsquo;d have every single translation of Dante that&rsquo;s ever been published in here, but rights issues complicate that dream.</p>
			<p>A further caveat: the texts were not perfect even when found, and probably more mistakes were added in markup conversion. But mistakes can be fixed.</p>
			<p>And there are a ton of bugs in this, some I know about and some I have no idea of. If you find something that&rsquo;s going wrong, let me know?</p>
			<p>I&rsquo;m currently working the bugs out of apps for Android and iOS devices; for the time being, these pages should work on mobile devices. Let me know if you&rsquo;re interested in testing the apps.</p>
