Ah! how hard a thing it is to tell what this wild and rough and dense wood was, which in thought renews the fear! So bitter is it that death is little more. But in order to treat of the good that there I found, I will tell of the other things that I have seen there. I cannot well recount how I entered it, so full was I of slumber at that point where I abandoned the true way. But after I had arrived at the foot of a hill, where that valley ended which had pierced my heart with fear, I looked on high, and saw its shoulders clothed already with the rays of the planet\n\t\t\t<span class="note">\n\t\t\t\t<span class="noteno">1</span>\n\t\t\t\t<span class="notetext">The sun, a planet according to the Ptolemaic system.</span>\n\t\t\t</span>\n\t\tthat leadeth men aright along every path. Then was the fear a little quieted which in the lake of my heart had lasted through the night that I passed so piteously. And even as one who with spent breath, issued out of the sea upon the shore, turns to the perilous water and gazes, so did my soul, which still was flying, turn back to look again upon the pass which never had a living person left.</p>\n\t\t<p>After I had rested a little my weary body I took my way again along the desert slope, so that the firm foot was always the lower. And ho! almost at the beginning of the steep a she-leopard, light and very nimble, which was covered with a spotted coat. And she did not move from before my face, nay, rather hindered so my road that to return I oftentimes had turned.</p>\n\t\t<p>The time was at the beginning of the morning, and the Sun was mounting upward with those stars that were with him when Love Divine first set in motion those beautiful things;\n\t\t\t<span class="note">\n\t\t\t\t<span class="noteno">2</span>\n\t\t\t\t<span class="notetext">According to old tradition the spring was the season of the creation.</span>\n\t\t\t</span>\n\t\tso that the hour of the time and the sweet season were occasion of good hope to me concerning that wild beast with the dappled skin. But not so that the sight which appeared to me of a lion did not give me fear. He seemed to be coming against me, with head high and with ravening hunger, so that it seemed that the air was affrighted at him. And a she-wolf,\n\t\t\t<span class="note">\n\t\t\t\t<span class="noteno">2</span>\n\t\t\t\t<span class="notetext">These three beasts correspond to the triple division of sins into those of incontinence, of violence, and of fraud. See Canto XI.</span>\n\t\t\t</span>\n\t\twho with all cravings seemed laden in her meagreness, and already had made many folk to live forlorn,&mdash;she caused me so much heaviness, with the fear that came from sight of her, that I lost hope of the height. And such as he is who gaineth willingly, and the time arrives that makes him lose, who in all his thoughts weeps and is sad,&mdash;such made me the beast without repose that, coming on against me, little by little was pushing me back thither where the Sun is silent.</p>\n\t\t<p>While I was falling back to the low place, before mine eyes appeared one who through long silence seemed hoarse. When I saw him in the great desert, &ldquo;Have pity on me!&rdquo; I cried to him, &ldquo;whatso thou art, or shade or real man.&rdquo; He answered me: &ldquo;Not man; man once I was, and my parents were Lombards, and Mantuans by country both. I was born sub Julio, though late, and I lived at Rome under the good Augustus, in the time of the false and lying gods.

And I came to thee as she willed. Thee have I delivered from that wild beast that took from thee the short ascent of the beautiful mountain. What is it then?

Now I would have thee know, before thou goest farther, that they sinned not; and if they have merits it sufficeth not, because they had not baptism, which is part of the faith that thou believest; and if they were before Christianity, they did not duly worship God: and of such as these am I myself. Through such defects, and not through other guilt, are we lost, and only so far harmed that without hope we live in desire.\u201D</p>\n\t\t<p>Great woe seized me at my heart when I heard him, because I knew that people of much worth were suspended in that limbo. \u201CTell me, my Master, tell me, Lord,\u201D began I, with wish to be assured of that faith which vanquishes every error,\n\t\t\t<span class="note">\n\t\t\t\t<span class="noteno">1</span>\n\t\t\t\t<span class="notetext">Wishing especially to be assured in regard to the descent of Christ into Hell.</span>\n\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t\u201Cdid ever any one who afterwards was blessed go out from here, either by his own or by another\u2019s merit?\u201D And he, who understood my covert speech, answered, \u201CI was new in this state when I saw a Mighty One come hither crowned with sign of victory. He drew out hence the shade of the first parent, of Abel his son, and that of Noah, of Moses the law-giver and obedient, Abraham the patriarch, and David the King, Israel with his father, and with his offspring, and with Rachel, for whom he did so much, and others many; and He made them blessed: and I would have thee know that before these, human spirits were not saved.\u201D</p>\n\t\t<p>We ceased not going on because he spoke, but all the while were passing through the wood, the wood I mean of crowded spirits. Nor yet had our way been long from where I slept, when I saw a fire, that conquered a hemisphere of darkness. We were still a little distant from it, yet not so far that I could not partially discern that honorable folk possessed that place. \u201CO thou that honorest both science and art, these, who are they, that have such honor that from the condition of the others it sets them apart?\u201D And he to me, \u201CThe honorable fame of them which resounds above in thy life wins grace in heaven that so advances them.\u201D At this a voice was heard by me, \u201CHonor the loftiest Poet! his shade returns that was departed.\u201D When the voice had ceased and was quiet, I saw four great shades coming to us: they had a semblance neither sad nor glad. The good Master began to say, \u201CLook at him with that sword in hand who cometh before the three, even as lord. He is Homer, the sovereign poet; the next who comes is Horace, the satirist; Ovid is the third, and the last is Lucan. Since each shares with me the name that the single voice sounded, they do me honor, and in that do well\u201D</p>\n\t\t<p>Thus I saw assembled the fair school of that Lord of the loftiest song which above the others as an eagle flies. After they had discoursed somewhat together, they turned to me with sign of salutation; and my Master smiled thereat. And far more of honor yet they did me, for they made me of their band, so that I was the sixth amid so much wit. Thus we went on as far as the light, speaking things concerning which silence is becoming, even as was speech there where I was.</p>\n\t\t<p>We came to the foot of a noble castle, seven times circled by high walls, defended round about by a fair streamlet. This we passed as if hard ground; through seven gates I entered with these sages; we came to a meadow of fresh verdure. People were there with eyes slow and grave, of great authority in their looks; they spake seldom, and with soft voices. Thus we drew apart, on one side, into a place open, luminous, and high, so that they all could be seen. There opposite upon the green enamel were shown to me the great spirits, whom to have seen I inwardly exalt myself.</p>\n\t\t<p>I saw Electra with many companions, among whom I knew both Hector and Aeneas, Caesar in armor, with his gerfalcon eyes; I saw Camilla and Penthesilea on the other side, and I saw the King Latinus, who was seated with Lavinia his daughter. I saw that Brutus who drove out Tarquin; Lucretia, Julia, Marcia, and Cornelia; and alone, apart, I saw the Saladin. When I raised my brow a little more, I saw the Master of those who know, seated amid the philosophic family; all regard him, all do him honor. Here I saw both Socrates and Plato, who before the others stand nearest to him; Democritus, who ascribes the world to chance; Diogenes, Anaxagoras, and Thales, Empedocles, Heraclitus, and Zeno; and I saw the good collector of the qualities, Dioscorides, I mean; and I saw Orpheus, Tully, and Linus, and moral Seneca, Euclid the geometer, and Ptolemy, Hippocrates, Avicenna, Galen, and Averrhoes, who made the great comment. I cannot report of all in full, because the long theme so drives me that many times speech comes short of fact.</p>\n\t\t<p>The company of six is reduced to two. By another way the wise guide leads me, out from the quiet, into the air that trembles, and I come into a region where is nothing that can give light.</p>','<p class="cantohead">CANTO V</p>\n\t\t<p class="summary">The Second Circle, that of Carnal Sinners.&mdash;Minos.&mdash;Shades renowned of old.&mdash;Francesca da Rimini.</p>\n\t\t<p>Thus I descended from the first circle down into the second, which girdles less space, and so much more woe that it goads to wailing. There abides Minos horribly, and snarls; he examines the sins at the entrance; he judges, and he sends according as he entwines himself. I mean, that, when the miscreant spirit comes there before him, it confesses itself wholly, and that discerner of sins sees what place of Hell is for it; he girdles himself with his tail so many times as the degrees he wills it should be sent down. Always before him stand many of them. They go, in turn, each to the judgment; they speak, and hear, and then are whirled below.</p>\n\t\t<p>\u201CO thou that comest to the woeful inn,\u201D said Minos to me, when he saw me, leaving the act of so great an office, \u201Cbeware how thou enterest, and to whom thou trustest thyself; let not the amplitude of the entrance deceive thee.\u201D And my Leader to him, \u201CWhy then dost thou cry out?

I had come into a place mute of all light, that bellows as the sea does in a tempest, if it be combated by opposing winds. The infernal hurricane that never rests carries along the spirits in its rapine; whirling and smiting it molests them. When they arrive before its rushing blast, here are shrieks, and bewailing, and lamenting; here they blaspheme the power divine. I understood that to such torment are condemned the carnal sinners who subject reason to appetite. And as their wings bear along the starlings in the cold season in a troop large and full, so that blast the evil spirits; hither, thither, down, up it carries them; no hope ever comforts them, not of repose, but even of less pain.</p>\n\t\t<p>And as the cranes go singing their lays, making in air a long line of themselves, so saw I come, uttering wails, shades borne along by the aforesaid strife. Wherefore I said, \u201CMaster, who are those folk whom the black air so castigates?\u201D \u201CThe first of these of whom thou wishest to have knowledge,\u201D said he to me then, \u201Cwas empress of many tongues. To the vice of luxury was she so abandoned that lust she made licit in her law, to take away the blame she had incurred. She is Semiramis, of whom it is read that she succeeded Ninus and had been his spouse; she held the land which the Soldan rules. That other is she who, for love, killed herself, and broke faith to the ashes of Sichaeus. Next is Cleopatra, the luxurious. See Helen, for whom so long a time of ill revolved; and see the great Achilles, who at the end fought with love. See Paris, Tristan,&mdash;\u201D and more than a thousand shades he showed me with his finger, and named them, whom love had parted from our life.</p>\n\t\t<p>After I had heard my Teacher name the dames of eld and the cavaliers, pity overcame me, and I was well nigh bewildered. I began, \u201CPoet, willingly would I speak with those two that go together, and seem to be so light upon the wind.\u201D And he to me, \u201CThou shalt see when they shall be nearer to us, and do thou then pray them by that love which leads them, and they will come.\u201D Soon as the wind sways them toward us I lifted my voice, \u201CO weary souls, come speak to us, if One forbid it not.\u201D</p>\n\t\t<p>As doves, called by desire, with wings open and steady, fly through the air to their sweet nest, borne by their will, these issued from the troop where Dido is, coming to us through the malign air, so strong was the compassionate cry.</p>\n\t\t<p>\u201CO living creature, gracious and benign, that goest through the lurid air visiting us who stained the world blood-red,&mdash;if the King of the universe were a friend we would pray Him for thy peace, since thou hast pity on our perverse ill. Of what it pleaseth thee to hear, and what to speak, we will hear and we will speak to you, while the wind, as now, is hushed for us. The city where I was born sits upon the sea-shore, where the Po, with its followers, descends to have peace. Love, that on gentle heart quickly lays hold, seized him for the fair person that was taken from me, and the mode still hurts me. Love, which absolves no loved one from loving, seized me for the pleasing of him so strongly that, as thou seest, it does not even now abandon me. Love brought us to one death. Caina awaits him who quenched our life.\u201D These words were borne to us from them.</p>\n\t\t<p>Soon as I had heard those injured souls I bowed my face, and held it down, until the Poet said to me, \u201CWhat art thou thinking?\u201D When I replied, I began, \u201CAlas! how many sweet thoughts, how great desire, led these unto the woeful pass.\u201D Then I turned me again to them, and I spoke, and began, \u201CFrancesca, thy torments make me sad and piteous to weeping. But tell me, at the time of the sweet sighs by what and how did love concede to you to know the dubious desires?\u201D And she to me, \u201CThere is no greater woe than in misery to remember the happy time, and that thy Teacher knows. But if to know the first root of our love thou hast so great a longing, I will do like one who weeps and tells.</p>\n\t\t<p>\u201CWe were reading one day, for delight, of Lancelot, how love constrained him. We were alone and without any suspicion. Many times that reading made us lift our eyes, and took the color from our faces, but only one point was that which overcame us. When we read of the longed-for smile being kissed by such a lover, this one, who never from me shall be divided, kissed my mouth all trembling. Galahaut was the book, and he who wrote it.

Its rule and quality are never new. Coarse hail, and foul water and snow pour down through the tenebrous air; the earth that receives them stinks. Cerberus, a beast cruel and monstrous, with three throats barks doglike above the people that are here submerged. He has vermilion eyes, and a greasy and black beard, and a big belly, and hands armed with claws: he tears the spirits, flays them, and rends them. The rain makes them howl like dogs; of one of their sides they make a screen for the other; the profane wretches often turn themselves.</p>\n\t\t<p>When Cerberus, the great worm, observed us he opened his mouths, and showed his fangs to us; not a limb had he that he kept quiet. And my Leader opened wide his hands, took some earth, and with full fists threw it into the ravenous gullets. As the dog that barking craves, and becomes quiet when he bites his food, and is intent and fights only to devour it, such became those filthy faces of the demon Cerberus, who so thunders at the souls that they would fain be deaf.</p>\n\t\t<p>We were passing over the shades whom the heavy rain subdues, and were setting our feet upon their vain show that seems a body. They all of them lay upon the ground, except one who raised himself to sit, quickly as he saw us passing before him. \u201CO thou who art led through this Hell,\u201D he said to me, \u201Crecognize me, if thou canst; thou wast made before I was unmade.\u201D And I to him, \u201CThe anguish which thou hast perchance withdraws thee from my memory, so that it seems not that I ever saw thee. But tell me who thou art, that in a place so woeful art set, and with such a punishment, that if any other is greater none is so displeasing.\u201D And he to me, \u201CThy city which is so full of envy, that already the sack runs over, held me in it, in the serene life.

And I, wretched soul, am not alone, for all these endure like punishment, for like sin,\u201D and more he said not. I answered him, \u201CCiacco, thy trouble so weighs upon me, that it invites me to weeping; but tell me, if thou canst, to what will come the citizens of the divided city; if any one in it is just; and tell me the reason why such great discord has assailed it.\u201D</p>\n\t\t<p>And he to me, \u201CAfter long contention they will come to blood, and the savage party will chase out the other with great injury. Thereafter within three suns it behoves this to fall, and the other to surmount through the force of one who even now is tacking. It will hold high its front long time, keeping the other under heavy burdens, however it may lament and be shamed thereat.

Farinata and the Tegghiaio who were so worthy, Jacopo Rusticucci, Arrigo, and the Mosca, and the rest who set their minds on well-doing, tell me where they are, and cause that I may know them, for great desire constrains me to learn if Heaven sweeten them, or Hell envenom.</p>\n\t\t<p>And he, \u201CThey are among the blacker souls: a different sin weighs them down to the bottom; if thou so far descendest, thou canst see them.

Though this accursed people never can attain to true perfection, it expects thereafter to be more than now.\u201D</p>\n\t\t<p>We took a circling course along that road, speaking far more than I repeat; and came to the point where the descent is.

Ah, Justice of God! Who heapeth up so many new travails and penalties as I saw? And why doth our sin so waste us? As doth the wave, yonder upon Charybdis, which is broken on that which it encounters, so it behoves that here the people counterdance.</p>\n\t\t<p>Here saw I people more than elsewhere many, and from one side and the other with great howls rolling weights by force of chest. They struck against each other, and then just there each turned, rolling backward, crying, \u201CWhy keepest thou?\u201D and \u201CWhy flingest thou away?\u201D Thus they turned through the dark circle on either hand to the opposite point, still crying out their opprobrious verse; then each, when he had come through his half circle, wheeled round to the other joust.</p>\n\t\t<p>And I, who had my heart well-nigh pierced through, said, \u201CMy Master, now declare to me what folk is this, and if all these tonsured ones on our left were clerks.\u201D</p>\n\t\t<p>And he to me, \u201CAll of these were so asquint in mind in the first life that they made no spending there with measure. Clearly enough their voices bay it out, when they come to the two points of the circle where the contrary sin divides them. These were clerks who have no hairy covering on their head, and Popes and Cardinals, in whom avarice practices its excess.\u201D</p>\n\t\t<p>And I, \u201CMaster, among such as these I ought surely to recognize some who were polluted with these evils.\u201D</p>\n\t\t<p>And he to me, \u201CVain thought thou harborest; the undiscerning life that made them foul, to all recognition now makes them dim. Forever will they come to the two buttings; these will rise from the sepulchre with closed fist, and these with shorn hair. Ill-giving and ill-keeping have taken from them the fair world, and set them to this scuffle; such as it is, I adorn not words for it. Now canst thou, son, see the brief jest of the goods that are committed unto Fortune, for which the human race so scramble; for all the gold that is beneath the moon, or that ever was, of these weary souls could not make a single one repose.\u201D</p>\n\t\t<p>\u201CMaster,\u201D said I to him, \u201Cnow tell me further; this Fortune, on which thou touchest for me, what is it, that hath the goods of the world so in its clutches?\u201D</p>\n\t\t<p>And he to me, \u201CO creatures foolish, how great is that ignorance that harms you! I would have thee now take in my judgment of her. He whose wisdom transcendeth all made the heavens, and gave them their guides, so that every part on every part doth shine, equally distributing the light. In like wise for the splendors of the world, He ordained a general ministress and guide, who should ever and anon transfer the vain goods from race to race, and from one blood to another, beyond the resistance of human wit. Wherefore one race rules, and the other languishes, pursuant to her judgment, which is occult as the snake in the grass. Your wisdom hath no withstanding of her: she provides, judges and maintains her realm, as theirs the other gods. Her permutations have no truce; necessity compels her to be swift, so often cometh he who obtains a turn. This is she who is so set upon the cross, even by those who ought to give her praise, giving her blame amiss and ill report. But she is blessed and hears this not. With the other Primal Creatures glad she turns her sphere, and blessed she rejoices. But now let us descend to greater woe. Already every star sinks that was rising when I set out, and too long stay is forbidden.\u201D</p>\n\t\t<p>We crossed the circle to the other bank, above a fount that boils and pours down through a cleft that proceeds from it.

A marsh it makes, that is named Styx, this dismal little stream, when it has descended to the foot of the malign gray slopes. And I, who stood intent to gaze, saw muddy people in that swamp, all naked and with look of hurt. They were smiting each other, not only with hands, but with head, and with chest, and with feet, mangling one another piecemeal with their teeth.</p>\n\t\t<p>The good Master said, \u201CSon, now thou seest the souls of those whom anger overcame; and likewise I would have thee believe for certain that beneath the water are folk who sigh, and make this water bubble at the surface, as thine eye tells thee wherever it turns. Fixed in the slime, they say, \u2018Sullen were we in the sweet air that by the Sun is gladdened, bearing within ourselves the sluggish fume; now we are sullen in the black mire.\u2019 This hymn they gurgle in their throats, for they cannot speak with entire words.\u201D\n\t\t\t<span class="note">\n\t\t\t\t<span class="noteno">1</span>\n\t\t\t\t<span class="notetext">The sin here punished is that known to the Middle Ages as <em>acedia</em>, or <em>accidie</em>,&mdash;slackness in good works, and spiritual gloom and despondency.

Soon as my Leader and I were in the boat, the antique prow goes its way, cutting more of the water than it is wont with others.</p>\n\t\t<p>While we were running through the dead channel, before me showed himself one full of mud, and said, \u201CWho art thou that comest before the hour?\u201D And I to him, \u201CIf I come I stay not; but thou, who art thou that art become so foul?\u201D He answered, \u201CThou seest that I am one who weeps.\u201D And I to him, \u201CWith weeping and with wailing, accursed spirit, do thou remain, for I know thee although thou art all filthy.\u201D Then he stretched to the boat both his hands, whereat the wary Master thrust him back, saying, \u201CBegone there, with the other dogs!\u201D Then with his arms he clasped my neck, kissed my face, and said, \u201CDisdainful soul, blessed be she who bore thee!

O me! see ye that other who is grinning: I would say more, but I fear lest he is making ready to scratch my itch.\u201D And the grand provost, turning to Farfarello, who was rolling his eyes as if to strike, said, \u201CGet thee away, wicked bird!\u201D</p>\n\t\t<p>\u201CIf you wish to see or to hear Tuscans or Lombards,\u201D thereon began again the frightened one, \u201CI will make them come; but let the Malebranche stand a little withdrawn, so that they may not be afraid of their vengeance, and I, sitting in this very place, for one that I am, will make seven of them come, when I shall whistle as is our wont to do whenever one of us comes out.\u201D Cagnazzo at this speech raised his muzzle, shaking his head, and said, \u201CHear the knavery he has devised for throwing himself under!\u201D Whereon he who had snares in great plenty answered, \u201CToo knavish am I, when I procure for mine own companions greater sorrow.\u201D Alichino held not in, and, in opposition to the others, said to him, \u201CIf thou dive, I will not come behind thee at a gallop, but I will beat my wings above the pitch; let the ridge be left, and be the bank a shield, to see if thou alone availest more than we.\u201D</p>\n\t\t<p>O thou that readest! thou shalt hear new sport. Each turned his eyes to the other side, he first who had been most averse to doing it. The Navarrese chose well his time, planted his feet firmly on the ground, and in an instant leaped, and from their purpose freed himself. At this, each of them was pricked with shame, but he most who was the cause of the loss; wherefore he started and cried out, \u201CThou art caught.\u201D But little it availed, for wings could not outstrip fear. The one went under, and the other, flying, turned his breast upward. Not otherwise the wild duck on a sudden dives when the falcon comes close, and he returns up vexed and baffled. Calcabrina, enraged at the flout, kept flying behind him, desirous that the sinner should escape, that he might have a scuffle; and when the barrator had disappeared he turned his talons upon his companion, and grappled with him above the ditch. But the other was indeed a sparrowhawk full grown to gripe him well, and both fell into the midst of the boiling pool. The heat was a sudden ungrappler, but nevertheless there was no rising from it, they had their wings so glued. Barbariccia, grieving with the rest of his troop, made four of them fly to the other side with all their forks, and very quickly, this side and that, they descended to their post.

My thought was turned by the present brawl upon the fable of Aesop, in which he tells of the frog and the mole; for NOW and THIS INSTANT are not more alike than the one is to the other, if beginning and end are rightly coupled by the attentive mind.\n\t\t\t<span class="note">\n\t\t\t\t<span class="noteno">1</span>\n\t\t\t\t<span class="notetext">\u201C<em>Sed dices forsan, lector,</em>\u201D says Benvenuto da Imola, \u201C<em>nescio per me videre quomodo istae duae fictiones habeant inter se tantam convenientam.

My Leader on a sudden took me, as a mother who is wakened by the noise, and near her sees the kindled flames, who takes her son and flies, and, having more care of him than of herself, stays not so long as only to put on a shift. And down from the ridge of the hard bank, supine he gave himself to the sloping rock that closes one of the sides of the next pit. Never ran water so swiftly through a duct, to turn the wheel of a land-mill, when it approaches nearest to the paddles, as my Master over that border, bearing me along upon his breast, as his own son, and not as his companion. Hardly had his feet reached the bed of the depth below, when they were on the ridge right over us; but here there was no fear, for the high Providence that willed to set them as ministers of the fifth ditch deprived them all of power of departing thence.</p>\n\t\t<p>There below we found a painted people who were going around with very slow steps, weeping, and in their semblance weary and vanquished.

After the battle of Montaperti (1260) the Ghibellines held the upper hand in Florence for more than five years. The defeat and death of Manfred early in 1266, at the battle of Benevento, shook their power and revived the hopes of the Guelphs. As a measure of compromise, the Florentine Commune elected two podestas, one from each party; the Guelph was Catalano de\u2019 Malavolti, the Ghibelline, Loderingo degli Andalo, both from Bologna. They were believed to have joined hands for their own gain, and to have favored the reviving power of the Guelphs. In the troubles of the year the houses of the Uberti, a powerful Ghibelline family, were burned. They lay in the region of the city called the Gardingo, close to the Palazzo Vecchio.</span>\n\t\t\t</span>\n\t\twere we, and Bolognese; I Catalano, and he Loderingo named, and together taken by thy city, as one man alone is wont to be taken, in order to preserve its peace; and we were such as still is apparent round about the Gardingo.\u201D I began, \u201CO Friars, your evil\u201D&mdash;but more I said not, for there struck mine eyes one crucified with three stakes on the ground.

The other two were looking on, and each cried, \u201CO me! Agnello, how thou changest! Lo, now thou art neither two nor one!

And that part whereby our nourishment is first taken it transfixed in one of them, then fell down stretched out before him. The transfixed one gazed at it, but said nothing; nay rather, with feet fixed, he yawned even as if sleep or fever had assailed him. He looked at the serpent, and that at him; one through his wound, the other through his mouth, smoked violently, and their smoke met. Let Lucan henceforth be silent, where he tells of the wretched Sabellus, and of Nasidius, and wait to hear that which now is uttered. Let Ovid be silent concerning Cadmus and Arethusa, for if, poetizing, he converts him into a serpent and her into a fountain, I envy him not; for two natures front to front never did he transmute, so that both the forms were prompt to exchange their matter. To one another they responded by such rules, that the serpent made his tail into a fork, and the wounded one drew together his feet. The legs and the very thighs with them so stuck together, that in short while the juncture made no sign that was apparent. The cleft tail took on the shape that was lost there, and its skin became soft, and that of the other hard. I saw the arms draw in through the armpits, and the two feet of the beast which were short lengthen out in proportion as those shortened.

Some are lying; some stand erect, this on his head, and that on his soles; another like a bow inverts his face to his feet.</p>\n\t\t<p>When we had gone so far forward that it pleased my Master to show me the creature that had the fair semblance, from before me he took himself and made me stop, saying, \u201CBehold Dis, and behold the place where it is needful that with fortitude thou arm thee.\u201D How I became then chilled and hoarse, ask it not, Reader, for I write it not, because all speech would be little. I did not die, and I did not remain alive. Think now for thyself, if thou hast grain of wit, what I became, deprived of one and the other.</p>\n\t\t<p>The emperor of the woeful realm from his midbreast issued forth from the ice; and I match better with a giant, than the giants do with his arms. See now how great must be that whole which corresponds to such parts. If he was as fair as he now is foul, and against his Maker lifted up his brow, surely may all tribulation proceed from him. Oh how great a marvel it seemed to me, when I saw three faces on his head! one in front, and that was red; the others were two that were joined to this above the very middle of each shoulder, and they were joined together at the place of the crest; and the right seemed between white and yellow, the left was such to sight as those who come from where the Nile flows valleyward. Beneath each came forth two great wings, of size befitting so huge a bird. Sails of the sea never saw I such. They had no feathers, but their fashion was of a bat; and he was flapping them so that three winds went forth from him, whereby Cocytus was all congealed. With six eyes he was weeping, and over three chins trickled the tears and bloody drivel. With each mouth he was crushing a sinner with his teeth, in manner of a brake, so that he thus was making three of them woeful. To the one in front the biting was nothing to the clawing, so that sometimes his spine remained all stripped of skin.</p>\n\t\t<p>\u201CThat soul up there which has the greatest punishment,\u201D said the Master, \u201Cis Judas Iscariot, who has his head within, and plies his legs outside. Of the other two who have their heads down, he who hangs from the black muzzle is Brutus; see how he writhes and says no word; and the other is Cassius, who seems so large-limbed. But the night is rising again, and now we must depart, for we have seen the whole.\u201D</p>\n\t\t<p>As was his pleasure, I clasped his neck, and he took opportunity of time and place, and when the wings were opened wide he caught hold on the shaggy flanks; from shag to shag he then descended between the bushy hair and the frozen crusts. When we were just where the thigh turns on the thick of the haunch, my Leader, with effort and stress of breath, turned his head where he had his shanks, and clambered by the hair as a man that ascends, so that I thought to return again to hell.</p>\n\t\t<p>\u201CCling fast hold,\u201D said the Master, panting like one weary, \u201Cfor by such stairs it behoves to depart from so much evil.\u201D Then he came forth through the opening of a rock, and placed me upon its edge to sit; then stretched toward me his cautious step.</p>\n\t\t<p>I raised my eyes, and thought to see Lucifer as I had left him, and I saw him holding his legs upward. And if I then became perplexed, let the dull folk think it that see not what that point is that I had passed.\n\t\t\t<span class="note">\n\t\t\t\t<span class="noteno">1</span>\n\t\t\t\t<span class="notetext">This point is the centre of the universe; when Virgil had turned upon the haunch of Lucifer, the passage had been made from one hemisphere of the earth&mdash;the inhabited and known hemisphere&mdash;to the other where no living men dwell, and where the only land is the mountain of Purgatory. In changing one hemisphere for the other there is a change of time of twelve hours. A second Saturday morning begins for the poets, and they pass nearly as long a time as they have been in Hell, that is, twenty-four hours, in traversing the long and hard way that leads through the new hemisphere on which they have just entered.</span>\n\t\t\t</span>\n\t\t</p>\n\t\t<p>\u201CRise up,\u201D said the Master, \u201Con thy feet; the way is long and the road is difficult, and already the sun unto mid-tierce\n\t\t\t<span class="note">\n\t\t\t\t<span class="noteno">1</span>\n\t\t\t\t<span class="notetext">Tierce is the church office sung at the third hour of the day, and the name is given to the first three hours after sunrise. Midtierce consequently here means about half-past seven o\u2019clock. In Hell Dante never mentions the sun to mark division of time, but now, having issued from Hell, Virgil marks the hour by a reference to the sun.</span>\n\t\t\t</span>\n\t\treturns.\u201D</p>\n\t\t<p>It was no hallway of a palace where we were, but a natural dungeon that had a bad floor, and lack of light. \u201CBefore I tear me from the abyss,\u201D said I when I had risen up, \u201Cmy Master, speak a little to me to draw me out of error. Where is the ice? and this one, how is he fixed thus upside down? and how in such short while has the sun from eve to morn made transit?\u201D And he to me, \u201CThou imaginest that thou still art on the other side of the centre where I laid hold on the hair of the guilty Worm that pierces the world. On that side wast thou so long as I descended; when I turned thou didst pass the point to which from all parts whatever has weight is drawn; and thou art now arrived beneath the hemisphere opposite to that which the great dry land covers, and beneath whose zenith the Man was slain who was born and lived without sin. Thou hast thy feet upon the little sphere which forms the other face of the Judecca. Here it is morning when there it is evening; and he who made for us a stairway with his hair is still fixed even as he was before. Upon this side he fell down from heaven, and the earth, which before was spread out here, through fear of him made of the sea a veil, and came to your hemisphere; and perchance to flee from him that land\n\t\t\t<span class="note">\n\t\t\t\t<span class="noteno">1</span>\n\t\t\t\t<span class="notetext">The Mount of Purgatory.</span>\n\t\t\t</span>\n\t\twhich on this side appears left here this empty space and upward ran back.\u201D</p>\n\t\t<p>A place is there below, stretching as far from Beelzebub as his tomb extends,\n\t\t\t<span class="note">\n\t\t\t\t<span class="noteno">1</span>\n\t\t\t\t<span class="notetext">Hell is his tomb; this vacant dark passage through the opposite hemisphere is, of course, of the same depth as Hell from surface to centre.</span>\n\t\t\t</span>\n\t\twhich not by sight is known, but by the sound of a rivulet that here descends along the hollow of a rock that it has gnawed with its course that winds and little falls. My Leader and I entered through that hidden way, to return to the bright world. And without care, to have any repose, we mounted up, he first and I second, till through a round opening I saw of those beauteous things which heaven bears, and thence we came forth to see again the stars.</p>']};

		 - Queueing: The logic that runs once the call has reached its point of execution in the element's $.queue() stack.
		 Most logic is placed here to avoid risking it becoming stale (if the element's properties have changed).
		 - Pushing: Consolidation of the tween data followed by its push onto the global in-progress calls container.

 Known Issues

 Velocity, however, doesn't make this distinction. Thus, converting to or from the % unit with these subproperties
 will produce an inaccurate conversion value. The same issue exists with the cx/cy attributes of SVG circles and ellipses. */
