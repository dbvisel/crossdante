# crossdante

An attempt at facing-page translation

This still needs a great deal of work!

 * _app/_ are the raw application files
  * _app/js/translations/_ are where translations live at the moment.
 * _dist/_ are the files for the web (demo version at https://danvisel.net/tempo/dante/inferno.html)
 * _crossdante/_ is the Cordova project

NPM build scripts are in _package.json_.
