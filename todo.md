# Things to do

(The master bug/feature list is in my local version of Asana.)

## features

 * Locally save canto, translation, chosen translations, day/night mode
 * Implement canto/translation as hash
 * Home/End/PageUp/PageDown key commands

## Bugs:

 * Percentages are still off when flipping translations
 * Centering of poetry is currently off a little bit (because of the 90 in the line measuring chunk)
 * Swiping up is still a little weird on Android (check other places?)

## Design

 * Settings page needs some help
 * Add this in: https://github.com/matejlatin/Gutenberg

## translations

 * Add Cary's notes
 * Add Norton Purgatorio/Paradiso
 * Need Gutenberg licenses

## features to add, this version:

 * line numbering
 * landscape mode with two translations scrolling together
 * save place with localstorage
