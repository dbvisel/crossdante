# to do

bugs: 

 * Centering of poetry is currently off a little bit
   * fixed for now?
 * Resizing (especially on a phone this is weird)
   * vh doesn't work very well on Android Chrome in portrait

tweaks:

 * better solution for icons
 * scrolling down at top or bottom of canto should go to previous or next

features to add:

 * line numbering
 * landscape mode with two translations scrolling together
 * Graphical swiping
 * save place with localstorage

other:

 * make a version of the first stanza: http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/245738

next version:

 * make a text-editable version of the original: it's a column, but when it's shown the text is always editable.  
   * how is this saved?
   * if this were to be a useful tool, how are texts loaded and changed?

 Make a responsive SCSS framework for certain breakpoints, base all sizes on that.
