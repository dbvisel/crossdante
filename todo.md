# Things to do

(The master bug/feature list is in my local version of Asana; if there's enough demand, I could move it to Github, though that isn't there right now.)

## Apps:

 * iOS apps are grinding through the app store & are not as up to date compared to other versions; there's a backlog there.

## Bugs:

 * Percentages are still off when flipping translations
 * Centering of poetry is currently off a little bit (because of the 90 in the line measuring chunk)
 * Swiping up is still a little weird on Android (check other places?)
  * Better appearance for twin mode at all resolutions

## Design

 * Settings page needs some help
 * Add this in: https://github.com/matejlatin/Gutenberg

## Features to add, this version:

  * line numbering
  * better translation metadata: we should know when a translation is from, for example.
  * ability to view notes as endnotes

## Translation changes

 * Add Cary's notes to Paradiso
 * Add Sibbald translations
 * Need Gutenberg licenses

## Longer term plans

 * Move translations to server
 		* Make single reader app that lets user download books as desired; books would be saved locally.
		* Ability to make editable version of original; this could then be uploaded to server as a new translation.
 * Better way of dealing with prose: essentially, paginate (pages flow left to right), translations would be stacked vertically.
 * Versioning: ability to include multiple versions of a text in a translation 
 * Image-handling: would be nice to have Gustave Dore illustrations as a translation.
