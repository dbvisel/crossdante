# to do

(replicates much of what I have locally in Asana)

## bugs:

 * Centering of poetry is currently off a little bit
 * Resizing (especially on a phone this is weird)
   * vh doesn't work very well on Android Chrome in portrait

## design

 * Add this in: https://github.com/matejlatin/Gutenberg

## tweaks:

 * better solution for icons, maybe https://css-tricks.com/ligature-icons/

## features to add, this version:

 * line numbering
 * landscape mode with two translations scrolling together
 * save place with localstorage

## next version:

 * make a text-editable version of the original: it's a column, but when it's shown the text is always editable.  
   * how is this saved?
   * if this were to be a useful tool, how are texts loaded and changed?
 * Make a responsive SCSS framework for certain breakpoints, base all sizes on that.
 * Look at Vivliostyle for pagination:
  * documentation: http://vivliostyle.com/en/about/
  * example: http://vivliostyle.github.io/vivliostyle.js/samples/css-secrets/viewer/vivliostyle-viewer.html#x=../doc/index.xhtml&spread=true&f=epubcfi(/2!/4/20[idp140542532235456]/10[idp140542532350000]/8[section-dry]/25:0)
