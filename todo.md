# to do

Add this in: https://github.com/matejlatin/Gutenberg
Better way to deal with icons: https://css-tricks.com/ligature-icons/

Look at Vivliostyle for pagination:
 * documentation: http://vivliostyle.com/en/about/
 * example: http://vivliostyle.github.io/vivliostyle.js/samples/css-secrets/viewer/vivliostyle-viewer.html#x=../doc/index.xhtml&spread=true&f=epubcfi(/2!/4/20[idp140542532235456]/10[idp140542532350000]/8[section-dry]/25:0)

bugs:

 * Centering of poetry is currently off a little bit
   * fixed for now?
 * Resizing (especially on a phone this is weird)
   * vh doesn't work very well on Android Chrome in portrait

tweaks:

 * better solution for icons
 * scrolling down at top or bottom of canto should go to previous or next

features to add:

 * line numbering
 * landscape mode with two translations scrolling together
 * Graphical swiping
		* Maybe this: http://scrollmagic.io/examples/advanced/section_wipes_manual.html
 * save place with localstorage

other:

 * make a version of the first stanza: http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poem/245738

next version:

 * make a text-editable version of the original: it's a column, but when it's shown the text is always editable.  
   * how is this saved?
   * if this were to be a useful tool, how are texts loaded and changed?

 Make a responsive SCSS framework for certain breakpoints, base all sizes on that.
