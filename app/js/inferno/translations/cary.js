		`<p class="cantohead">Canto I</p>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>In the midway of this our mortal life,</p>
		<p>I found me in a gloomy wood, astray</p>
		<p>Gone from the path direct: and e&rsquo;en to tell</p>
		<p>It were no easy task, how savage wild</p>
		<p>That forest, how robust and rough its growth,</p>
		<p>Which to remember only, my dismay</p>
		<p>Renews, in bitterness not far from death.</p>
		<p>Yet to discourse of what there good befell,</p>
		<p>All else will I relate discover&rsquo;d there.</p>
		<p>How first I enter&rsquo;d it I scarce can say,</p>
		<p>Such sleepy dullness in that instant weigh&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>My senses down, when the true path I left,</p>
		<p>But when a mountain&rsquo;s foot I reach&rsquo;d, where clos&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>The valley, that had pierc&rsquo;d my heart with dread,</p>
		<p>I look&rsquo;d aloft, and saw his shoulders broad</p>
		<p>Already vested with that planet&rsquo;s beam,</p>
		<p>Who leads all wanderers safe through every way.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>Then was a little respite to the fear,</p>
		<p>That in my heart&rsquo;s recesses deep had lain,</p>
		<p>All of that night, so pitifully pass&rsquo;d:</p>
		<p>And as a man, with difficult short breath,</p>
		<p>Forespent with toiling, &rsquo;scap&rsquo;d from sea to shore,</p>
		<p>Turns to the perilous wide waste, and stands</p>
		<p>At gaze; e&rsquo;en so my spirit, that yet fail&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Struggling with terror, turn&rsquo;d to view the straits,</p>
		<p>That none hath pass&rsquo;d and liv&rsquo;d. My weary frame</p>
		<p>After short pause recomforted, again</p>
		<p>I journey&rsquo;d on over that lonely steep,</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>The hinder foot still firmer. Scarce the ascent</p>
		<p>Began, when, lo! a panther, nimble, light,</p>
		<p>And cover&rsquo;d with a speckled skin, appear&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Nor, when it saw me, vanish&rsquo;d, rather strove</p>
		<p>To check my onward going; that ofttimes</p>
		<p>With purpose to retrace my steps I turn&rsquo;d.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>The hour was morning&rsquo;s prime, and on his way</p>
		<p>Aloft the sun ascended with those stars,</p>
		<p>That with him rose, when Love divine first mov&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Those its fair works: so that with joyous hope</p>
		<p>All things conspir&rsquo;d to fill me, the gay skin</p>
		<p>Of that swift animal, the matin dawn</p>
		<p>And the sweet season. Soon that joy was chas&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>And by new dread succeeded, when in view</p>
		<p>A lion came, &rsquo;gainst me, as it appear&rsquo;d,</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>With his head held aloft and hunger-mad,</p>
		<p>That e&rsquo;en the air was fear-struck. A she-wolf</p>
		<p>Was at his heels, who in her leanness seem&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Full of all wants, and many a land hath made</p>
		<p>Disconsolate ere now. She with such fear</p>
		<p>O&rsquo;erwhelmed me, at the sight of her appall&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>That of the height all hope I lost. As one,</p>
		<p>Who with his gain elated, sees the time</p>
		<p>When all unwares is gone, he inwardly</p>
		<p>Mourns with heart-griping anguish; such was I,</p>
		<p>Haunted by that fell beast, never at peace,</p>
		<p>Who coming o&rsquo;er against me, by degrees</p>
		<p>Impell&rsquo;d me where the sun in silence rests.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>While to the lower space with backward step</p>
		<p>I fell, my ken discern&rsquo;d the form one of one,</p>
		<p>Whose voice seem&rsquo;d faint through long disuse of speech.</p>
		<p>When him in that great desert I espied,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Have mercy on me!&rdquo; cried I out aloud,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Spirit! or living man! what e&rsquo;er thou be!&rdquo;</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>He answer&rsquo;d:&ldquo;ow not man, man once I was,</p>
		<p>And born of Lombard parents, Mantuana both</p>
		<p>By country, when the power of Julius yet</p>
		<p>Was scarcely firm. At Rome my life was past</p>
		<p>Beneath the mild Augustus, in the time</p>
		<p>Of fabled deities and false. A bard</p>
		<p>Was I, and made Anchises&rsquo; upright son</p>
		<p>The subject of my song, who came from Troy,</p>
		<p>When the flames prey&rsquo;d on Ilium&rsquo;s haughty towers.</p>
		<p>But thou, say wherefore to such perils past</p>
		<p>Return&rsquo;st thou? wherefore not this pleasant mount</p>
		<p>Ascendest, cause and source of all delight?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;And art thou then that Virgil, that well-spring,</p>
		<p>From which such copious floods of eloquence</p>
		<p>Have issued?&rdquo; I with front abash&rsquo;d replied.</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Glory and light of all the tuneful train!</p>
		<p>May it avail me that I long with zeal</p>
		<p>Have sought thy volume, and with love immense</p>
		<p>Have conn&rsquo;d it o&rsquo;er. My master thou and guide!</p>
		<p>Thou he from whom alone I have deriv&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>That style, which for its beauty into fame</p>
		<p>Exalts me. See the beast, from whom I fled.</p>
		<p>O save me from her, thou illustrious sage!&rdquo;</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>&ldquo;For every vein and pulse throughout my frame</p>
		<p>She hath made tremble.&rdquo; He, soon as he saw</p>
		<p>That I was weeping, answer&rsquo;d, &ldquo;Thou must needs</p>
		<p>Another way pursue, if thou wouldst &rsquo;scape</p>
		<p>From out that savage wilderness. This beast,</p>
		<p>At whom thou criest, her way will suffer none</p>
		<p>To pass, and no less hindrance makes than death:</p>
		<p>So bad and so accursed in her kind,</p>
		<p>That never sated is her ravenous will,</p>
		<p>Still after food more craving than before.</p>
		<p>To many an animal in wedlock vile</p>
		<p>She fastens, and shall yet to many more,</p>
		<p>Until that greyhound come, who shall destroy</p>
		<p>Her with sharp pain. He will not life support</p>
		<p>By earth nor its base metals, but by love,</p>
		<p>Wisdom, and virtue, and his land shall be</p>
		<p>The land &rsquo;twixt either Feltro. In his might</p>
		<p>Shall safety to Italia&rsquo;s plains arise,</p>
		<p>For whose fair realm, Camilla, virgin pure,</p>
		<p>Nisus, Euryalus, and Turnus fell.</p>
		<p>He with incessant chase through every town</p>
		<p>Shall worry, until he to hell at length</p>
		<p>Restore her, thence by envy first let loose.</p>
		<p>I for thy profit pond&rsquo;ring now devise,</p>
		<p>That thou mayst follow me, and I thy guide</p>
		<p>Will lead thee hence through an eternal space,</p>
		<p>Where thou shalt hear despairing shrieks, and see</p>
		<p>Spirits of old tormented, who invoke</p>
		<p>A second death; and those next view, who dwell</p>
		<p>Content in fire, for that they hope to come,</p>
		<p>Whene&rsquo;er the time may be, among the blest,</p>
		<p>Into whose regions if thou then desire</p>
		<p>T&rsquo; ascend, a spirit worthier then I</p>
		<p>Must lead thee, in whose charge, when I depart,</p>
		<p>Thou shalt be left: for that Almighty King,</p>
		<p>Who reigns above, a rebel to his law,</p>
		<p>Adjudges me, and therefore hath decreed,</p>
		<p>That to his city none through me should come.</p>
		<p>He in all parts hath sway; there rules, there holds</p>
		<p>His citadel and throne. O happy those,</p>
		<p>Whom there he chooses!&rdquo; I to him in few:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Bard! by that God, whom thou didst not adore,</p>
		<p>I do beseech thee (that this ill and worse</p>
		<p>I may escape) to lead me, where thou saidst,</p>
		<p>That I Saint Peter&rsquo;s gate may view, and those</p>
		<p>Who as thou tell&rsquo;st, are in such dismal plight.&rdquo;</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>Onward he mov&rsquo;d, I close his steps pursu&rsquo;d.</p>
		</div>`,

		`<p class="cantohead">Canto II</p>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>NOW was the day departing, and the air,</p>
		<p>Imbrown&rsquo;d with shadows, from their toils releas&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>All animals on earth; and I alone</p>
		<p>Prepar&rsquo;d myself the conflict to sustain,</p>
		<p>Both of sad pity, and that perilous road,</p>
		<p>Which my unerring memory shall retrace.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>O Muses! O high genius! now vouchsafe</p>
		<p>Your aid! O mind! that all I saw hast kept</p>
		<p>Safe in a written record, here thy worth</p>
		<p>And eminent endowments come to proof.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>I thus began: &ldquo;Bard! thou who art my guide,</p>
		<p>Consider well, if virtue be in me</p>
		<p>Sufficient, ere to this high enterprise</p>
		<p>Thou trust me. Thou hast told that Silvius&rsquo; sire,</p>
		<p>Yet cloth&rsquo;d in corruptible flesh, among</p>
		<p>Th&rsquo; immortal tribes had entrance, and was there</p>
		<p>Sensible present. Yet if heaven&rsquo;s great Lord,</p>
		<p>Almighty foe to ill, such favour shew&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>In contemplation of the high effect,</p>
		<p>Both what and who from him should issue forth,</p>
		<p>It seems in reason&rsquo;s judgment well deserv&rsquo;d:</p>
		<p>Sith he of Rome, and of Rome&rsquo;s empire wide,</p>
		<p>In heaven&rsquo;s empyreal height was chosen sire:</p>
		<p>Both which, if truth be spoken, were ordain&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>And &rsquo;stablish&rsquo;d for the holy place, where sits</p>
		<p>Who to great Peter&rsquo;s sacred chair succeeds.</p>
		<p>He from this journey, in thy song renown&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Learn&rsquo;d things, that to his victory gave rise</p>
		<p>And to the papal robe. In after-times</p>
		<p>The chosen vessel also travel&rsquo;d there,</p>
		<p>To bring us back assurance in that faith,</p>
		<p>Which is the entrance to salvation&rsquo;s way.</p>
		<p>But I, why should I there presume? or who</p>
		<p>Permits it? not, Aeneas I nor Paul.</p>
		<p>Myself I deem not worthy, and none else</p>
		<p>Will deem me. I, if on this voyage then</p>
		<p>I venture, fear it will in folly end.</p>
		<p>Thou, who art wise, better my meaning know&rsquo;st,</p>
		<p>Than I can speak.&rdquo; As one, who unresolves</p>
		<p>What he hath late resolv&rsquo;d, and with new thoughts</p>
		<p>Changes his purpose, from his first intent</p>
		<p>Remov&rsquo;d; e&rsquo;en such was I on that dun coast,</p>
		<p>Wasting in thought my enterprise, at first</p>
		<p>So eagerly embrac&rsquo;d. &ldquo;If right thy words</p>
		<p>I scan,&rdquo; replied that shade magnanimous,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Thy soul is by vile fear assail&rsquo;d, which oft</p>
		<p>So overcasts a man, that he recoils</p>
		<p>From noblest resolution, like a beast</p>
		<p>At some false semblance in the twilight gloom.</p>
		<p>That from this terror thou mayst free thyself,</p>
		<p>I will instruct thee why I came, and what</p>
		<p>I heard in that same instant, when for thee</p>
		<p>Grief touch&rsquo;d me first. I was among the tribe,</p>
		<p>Who rest suspended, when a dame, so blest</p>
		<p>And lovely, I besought her to command,</p>
		<p>Call&rsquo;d me; her eyes were brighter than the star</p>
		<p>Of day; and she with gentle voice and soft</p>
		<p>Angelically tun&rsquo;d her speech address&rsquo;d:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;O courteous shade of Mantua! thou whose fame</p>
		<p>Yet lives, and shall live long as nature lasts!</p>
		<p>A friend, not of my fortune but myself,</p>
		<p>On the wide desert in his road has met</p>
		<p>Hindrance so great, that he through fear has turn&rsquo;d.</p>
		<p>Now much I dread lest he past help have stray&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>And I be ris&rsquo;n too late for his relief,</p>
		<p>From what in heaven of him I heard. Speed now,</p>
		<p>And by thy eloquent persuasive tongue,</p>
		<p>And by all means for his deliverance meet,</p>
		<p>Assist him. So to me will comfort spring.</p>
		<p>I who now bid thee on this errand forth</p>
		<p>Am Beatrice<span class="note"><span class="noteno">1</span><span class="notetext">I use this word, as it is pronounced in the Italian, as consisting of four syllables, of which the third is a long one.</span></span>; from a place I come</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>Revisited with joy. Love brought me thence,</p>
		<p>Who prompts my speech. When in my Master&rsquo;s sight</p>
		<p>I stand, thy praise to him I oft will tell.&rdquo;</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>She then was silent, and I thus began:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;O Lady! by whose influence alone,</p>
		<p>Mankind excels whatever is contain&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Within that heaven which hath the smallest orb,</p>
		<p>So thy command delights me, that to obey,</p>
		<p>If it were done already, would seem late.</p>
		<p>No need hast thou farther to speak thy will;</p>
		<p>Yet tell the reason, why thou art not loth</p>
		<p>To leave that ample space, where to return</p>
		<p>Thou burnest, for this centre here beneath.&rdquo;</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>She then: &ldquo;Since thou so deeply wouldst inquire,</p>
		<p>I will instruct thee briefly, why no dread</p>
		<p>Hinders my entrance here. Those things alone</p>
		<p>Are to be fear&rsquo;d, whence evil may proceed,</p>
		<p>None else, for none are terrible beside.</p>
		<p>I am so fram&rsquo;d by God, thanks to his grace!</p>
		<p>That any suff&rsquo;rance of your misery</p>
		<p>Touches me not, nor flame of that fierce fire</p>
		<p>Assails me. In high heaven a blessed dame</p>
		<p>Besides, who mourns with such effectual grief</p>
		<p>That hindrance, which I send thee to remove,</p>
		<p>That God&rsquo;s stern judgment to her will inclines.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>To Lucia calling, her she thus bespake:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Now doth thy faithful servant need thy aid</p>
		<p>And I commend him to thee.&rdquo; At her word</p>
		<p>Sped Lucia, of all cruelty the foe,</p>
		<p>And coming to the place, where I abode</p>
		<p>Seated with Rachel, her of ancient days,</p>
		<p>She thus address&rsquo;d me: &ldquo;Thou true praise of God!</p>
		<p>Beatrice! why is not thy succour lent</p>
		<p>To him, who so much lov&rsquo;d thee, as to leave</p>
		<p>For thy sake all the multitude admires?</p>
		<p>Dost thou not hear how pitiful his wail,</p>
		<p>Nor mark the death, which in the torrent flood,</p>
		<p>Swoln mightier than a sea, him struggling holds?&rdquo;</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Ne&rsquo;er among men did any with such speed</p>
		<p>Haste to their profit, flee from their annoy,</p>
		<p>As when these words were spoken, I came here,</p>
		<p>Down from my blessed seat, trusting the force</p>
		<p>Of thy pure eloquence, which thee, and all</p>
		<p>Who well have mark&rsquo;d it, into honour brings.&rdquo;</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>&ldquo;When she had ended, her bright beaming eyes</p>
		<p>Tearful she turn&rsquo;d aside; whereat I felt</p>
		<p>Redoubled zeal to serve thee. As she will&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Thus am I come: I sav&rsquo;d thee from the beast,</p>
		<p>Who thy near way across the goodly mount</p>
		<p>Prevented. What is this comes o&rsquo;er thee then?</p>
		<p>Why, why dost thou hang back? why in thy breast</p>
		<p>Harbour vile fear? why hast not courage there</p>
		<p>And noble daring? Since three maids so blest</p>
		<p>Thy safety plan, e&rsquo;en in the court of heaven;</p>
		<p>And so much certain good my words forebode.&rdquo;</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>As florets, by the frosty air of night</p>
		<p>Bent down and clos&rsquo;d, when day has blanch&rsquo;d their leaves,</p>
		<p>Rise all unfolded on their spiry stems;</p>
		<p>So was my fainting vigour new restor&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>And to my heart such kindly courage ran,</p>
		<p>That I as one undaunted soon replied:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;O full of pity she, who undertook</p>
		<p>My succour! and thou kind who didst perform</p>
		<p>So soon her true behest! With such desire</p>
		<p>Thou hast dispos&rsquo;d me to renew my voyage,</p>
		<p>That my first purpose fully is resum&rsquo;d.</p>
		<p>Lead on: one only will is in us both.</p>
		<p>Thou art my guide, my master thou, and lord.&rdquo;</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>So spake I; and when he had onward mov&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>I enter&rsquo;d on the deep and woody way.</p>
		</div>`,

		`<p class="cantohead">Canto III</p>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>&ldquo;THROUGH me you pass into the city of woe:</p>
		<p>Through me you pass into eternal pain:</p>
		<p>Through me among the people lost for aye.</p>
		<p>Justice the founder of my fabric mov&rsquo;d:</p>
		<p>To rear me was the task of power divine,</p>
		<p>Supremest wisdom, and primeval love.</p>
		<p>Before me things create were none, save things</p>
		<p>Eternal, and eternal I endure.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>&ldquo;All hope abandon ye who enter here.&rdquo;</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>Such characters in colour dim I mark&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Over a portal&rsquo;s lofty arch inscrib&rsquo;d:</p>
		<p>Whereat I thus: &ldquo;Master, these words import</p>
		<p>Hard meaning.&rdquo; He as one prepar&rsquo;d replied:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Here thou must all distrust behind thee leave;</p>
		<p>Here be vile fear extinguish&rsquo;d. We are come</p>
		<p>Where I have told thee we shall see the souls</p>
		<p>To misery doom&rsquo;d, who intellectual good</p>
		<p>Have lost.&rdquo; And when his hand he had stretch&rsquo;d forth</p>
		<p>To mine, with pleasant looks, whence I was cheer&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Into that secret place he led me on.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>Here sighs with lamentations and loud moans</p>
		<p>Resounded through the air pierc&rsquo;d by no star,</p>
		<p>That e&rsquo;en I wept at entering. Various tongues,</p>
		<p>Horrible languages, outcries of woe,</p>
		<p>Accents of anger, voices deep and hoarse,</p>
		<p>With hands together smote that swell&rsquo;d the sounds,</p>
		<p>Made up a tumult, that for ever whirls</p>
		<p>Round through that air with solid darkness stain&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Like to the sand that in the whirlwind flies.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>I then, with error yet encompass&rsquo;d, cried:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;O master! What is this I hear? What race</p>
		<p>Are these, who seem so overcome with woe?&rdquo;</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>He thus to me: &ldquo;This miserable fate</p>
		<p>Suffer the wretched souls of those, who liv&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Without or praise or blame, with that ill band</p>
		<p>Of angels mix&rsquo;d, who nor rebellious prov&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Nor yet were true to God, but for themselves</p>
		<p>Were only. From his bounds Heaven drove them forth,</p>
		<p>Not to impair his lustre, nor the depth</p>
		<p>Of Hell receives them, lest th&rsquo; accursed tribe</p>
		<p>Should glory thence with exultation vain.&rdquo;</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>I then: &ldquo;Master! what doth aggrieve them thus,</p>
		<p>That they lament so loud?&rdquo; He straight replied:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;That will I tell thee briefly. These of death</p>
		<p>No hope may entertain: and their blind life</p>
		<p>So meanly passes, that all other lots</p>
		<p>They envy. Fame of them the world hath none,</p>
		<p>Nor suffers; mercy and justice scorn them both.</p>
		<p>Speak not of them, but look, and pass them by.&rdquo;</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>And I, who straightway look&rsquo;d, beheld a flag,</p>
		<p>Which whirling ran around so rapidly,</p>
		<p>That it no pause obtain&rsquo;d: and following came</p>
		<p>Such a long train of spirits, I should ne&rsquo;er</p>
		<p>Have thought, that death so many had despoil&rsquo;d.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>When some of these I recogniz&rsquo;d, I saw</p>
		<p>And knew the shade of him, who to base fear</p>
		<p>Yielding, abjur&rsquo;d his high estate. Forthwith</p>
		<p>I understood for certain this the tribe</p>
		<p>Of those ill spirits both to God displeasing</p>
		<p>And to his foes. These wretches, who ne&rsquo;er lived,</p>
		<p>Went on in nakedness, and sorely stung</p>
		<p>By wasps and hornets, which bedew&rsquo;d their cheeks</p>
		<p>With blood, that mix&rsquo;d with tears dropp&rsquo;d to their feet,</p>
		<p>And by disgustful worms was gather&rsquo;d there.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>Then looking farther onwards I beheld</p>
		<p>A throng upon the shore of a great stream:</p>
		<p>Whereat I thus: &ldquo;Sir! grant me now to know</p>
		<p>Whom here we view, and whence impell&rsquo;d they seem</p>
		<p>So eager to pass o&rsquo;er, as I discern</p>
		<p>Through the blear light?&rdquo; He thus to me in few:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;This shalt thou know, soon as our steps arrive</p>
		<p>Beside the woeful tide of Acheron.&rdquo;</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>Then with eyes downward cast and fill&rsquo;d with shame,</p>
		<p>Fearing my words offensive to his ear,</p>
		<p>Till we had reach&rsquo;d the river, I from speech</p>
		<p>Abstain&rsquo;d. And lo! toward us in a bark</p>
		<p>Comes on an old man hoary white with eld,</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>Crying, &ldquo;Woe to you wicked spirits! hope not</p>
		<p>Ever to see the sky again. I come</p>
		<p>To take you to the other shore across,</p>
		<p>Into eternal darkness, there to dwell</p>
		<p>In fierce heat and in ice. And thou, who there</p>
		<p>Standest, live spirit! get thee hence, and leave</p>
		<p>These who are dead.&rdquo; But soon as he beheld</p>
		<p>I left them not, &ldquo;By other way,&rdquo; said he,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;By other haven shalt thou come to shore,</p>
		<p>Not by this passage; thee a nimbler boat</p>
		<p>Must carry.&rdquo; Then to him thus spake my guide:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Charon! thyself torment not: so &rsquo;t is will&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Where will and power are one: ask thou no more.&rdquo;</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>Straightway in silence fell the shaggy cheeks</p>
		<p>Of him the boatman o&rsquo;er the livid lake,</p>

		<p>Those spirits, faint and naked, color chang&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>And gnash&rsquo;d their teeth, soon as the cruel words</p>
		<p>They heard. God and their parents they blasphem&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>The human kind, the place, the time, and seed</p>
		<p>That did engender them and give them birth.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>Then all together sorely wailing drew</p>
		<p>To the curs&rsquo;d strand, that every man must pass</p>
		<p>Who fears not God. Charon, demoniac form,</p>
		<p>With eyes of burning coal, collects them all,</p>
		<p>Beck&rsquo;ning, and each, that lingers, with his oar</p>
		<p>Strikes. As fall off the light autumnal leaves,</p>
		<p>One still another following, till the bough</p>
		<p>Strews all its honours on the earth beneath;</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>e&rsquo;en in like manner Adam&rsquo;s evil brood</p>

		<div class="stanza">
		<p>Thus go they over through the umber&rsquo;d wave,</p>

		<p>&ldquo;Those, who die subject to the wrath of God,</p>

		<div class="stanza">
		<p>This said, the gloomy region trembling shook</p>
		<p>So terribly, that yet with clammy dews</p>
		<p>Fear chills my brow. The sad earth gave a blast,</p>
		<p>That, lightening, shot forth a vermilion flame,</p>
		<p>Which all my senses conquer&rsquo;d quite, and I</p>

		`<p class="cantohead">Canto IV</p>

		<p>BROKE the deep slumber in my brain a crash</p>
		<p>Of heavy thunder, that I shook myself,</p>
		<p>As one by main force rous&rsquo;d. Risen upright,</p>
		<p>My rested eyes I mov&rsquo;d around, and search&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>With fixed ken to know what place it was,</p>
		<p>Wherein I stood. For certain on the brink</p>
		<p>I found me of the lamentable vale,</p>
		<p>The dread abyss, that joins a thund&rsquo;rous sound</p>
		<p>Of plaints innumerable. Dark and deep,</p>
		<p>And thick with clouds o&rsquo;erspread, mine eye in vain</p>
		<p>Explor&rsquo;d its bottom, nor could aught discern.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>&ldquo;Now let us to the blind world there beneath</p>

		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>Then I his alter&rsquo;d hue perceiving, thus:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;How may I speed, if thou yieldest to dread,</p>
		<p>Who still art wont to comfort me in doubt?&rdquo;</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>He then: &ldquo;The anguish of that race below</p>
		<p>With pity stains my cheek, which thou for fear</p>
		<p>Mistakest. Let us on. Our length of way</p>
		<p>Urges to haste.&rdquo; Onward, this said, he mov&rsquo;d;</p>
		<p>And ent&rsquo;ring led me with him on the bounds</p>
		<p>Of the first circle, that surrounds th&rsquo; abyss.</p>
		<p>Here, as mine ear could note, no plaint was heard</p>
		<p>Except of sighs, that made th&rsquo; eternal air</p>
		<p>Tremble, not caus&rsquo;d by tortures, but from grief</p>
		<p>Felt by those multitudes, many and vast,</p>
		<p>Of men, women, and infants. Then to me</p>
		<p>The gentle guide: &ldquo;Inquir&rsquo;st thou not what spirits</p>
		<p>Are these, which thou beholdest? Ere thou pass</p>
		<p>Farther, I would thou know, that these of sin</p>
		<p>Were blameless; and if aught they merited,</p>
		<p>It profits not, since baptism was not theirs,</p>
		<p>The portal to thy faith. If they before</p>
		<p>The Gospel liv&rsquo;d, they serv&rsquo;d not God aright;</p>
		<p>And among such am I. For these defects,</p>
		<p>And for no other evil, we are lost;&rdquo;</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>&ldquo;Only so far afflicted, that we live</p>
		<p>Desiring without hope.&rdquo; So grief assail&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>My heart at hearing this, for well I knew</p>
		<p>Suspended in that Limbo many a soul</p>
		<p>Of mighty worth. &ldquo;O tell me, sire rever&rsquo;d!</p>
		<p>Tell me, my master!&rdquo; I began through wish</p>
		<p>Of full assurance in that holy faith,</p>
		<p>Which vanquishes all error; &ldquo;say, did e&rsquo;er</p>
		<p>Any, or through his own or other&rsquo;s merit,</p>
		<p>Come forth from thence, whom afterward was blest?&rdquo;</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>Piercing the secret purport of my speech,</p>
		<p>He answer&rsquo;d: &ldquo;I was new to that estate,</p>
		<p>When I beheld a puissant one arrive</p>
		<p>Amongst us, with victorious trophy crown&rsquo;d.</p>
		<p>He forth the shade of our first parent drew,</p>
		<p>Abel his child, and Noah righteous man,</p>
		<p>Of Moses lawgiver for faith approv&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Of patriarch Abraham, and David king,</p>
		<p>Israel with his sire and with his sons,</p>
		<p>Nor without Rachel whom so hard he won,</p>
		<p>And others many more, whom he to bliss</p>
		<p>Exalted. Before these, be thou assur&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>No spirit of human kind was ever sav&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>We, while he spake, ceas&rsquo;d not our onward road,</p>
		<p>Still passing through the wood; for so I name</p>
		<p>Those spirits thick beset. We were not far</p>
		<p>On this side from the summit, when I kenn&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>A flame, that o&rsquo;er the darken&rsquo;d hemisphere</p>
		<p>Prevailing shin&rsquo;d. Yet we a little space</p>
		<p>Were distant, not so far but I in part</p>
		<p>Discover&rsquo;d, that a tribe in honour high</p>
		<p>That place possess&rsquo;d. &ldquo;O thou, who every art</p>
		<p>And science valu&rsquo;st! who are these, that boast</p>
		<p>Such honour, separate from all the rest?&rdquo;</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>He answer&rsquo;d: &ldquo;The renown of their great names</p>
		<p>That echoes through your world above, acquires</p>
		<p>Favour in heaven, which holds them thus advanc&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Meantime a voice I heard: &ldquo;Honour the bard</p>
		<p>Sublime! his shade returns that left us late!&rdquo;</p>
		<p>No sooner ceas&rsquo;d the sound, than I beheld</p>
		<p>Four mighty spirits toward us bend their steps,</p>
		<p>Of semblance neither sorrowful nor glad.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>When thus my master kind began: &ldquo;Mark him,</p>
		<p>Who in his right hand bears that falchion keen,</p>
		<p>The other three preceding, as their lord.</p>
		<p>This is that Homer, of all bards supreme:</p>
		<p>Flaccus the next in satire&rsquo;s vein excelling;</p>
		<p>The third is Naso; Lucan is the last.</p>
		<p>Because they all that appellation own,</p>
		<p>With which the voice singly accosted me,</p>
		<p>Honouring they greet me thus, and well they judge.&rdquo;</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>So I beheld united the bright school</p>
		<p>Of him the monarch of sublimest song,</p>
		<p>That o&rsquo;er the others like an eagle soars.</p>
		<p>When they together short discourse had held,</p>
		<p>They turn&rsquo;d to me, with salutation kind</p>
		<p>Beck&rsquo;ning me; at the which my master smil&rsquo;d:</p>
		<p>Nor was this all; but greater honour still</p>
		<p>They gave me, for they made me of their tribe;</p>
		<p>And I was sixth amid so learn&rsquo;d a band.</p>

		<p>Seven times with lofty walls begirt, and round</p>
		<p>Defended by a pleasant stream. O&rsquo;er this</p>
		<p>As o&rsquo;er dry land we pass&rsquo;d. Next through seven gates</p>

		<p>Into a mead with lively verdure fresh.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>There dwelt a race, who slow their eyes around</p>

		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>We to one side retir&rsquo;d, into a place</p>
		<p>Open and bright and lofty, whence each one</p>

		<p>Were shown me the great spirits, by whose sight</p>
		<p>I am exalted in my own esteem.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>Electra there I saw accompanied</p>

		<p>Penthesilea. On the other side</p>
		<p>Old King Latinus, seated by his child</p>

		<p>There Socrates and Plato both I mark&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Nearest to him in rank; Democritus,</p>

		<p>My sage guide leads me, from that air serene,</p>
		<p>Into a climate ever vex&rsquo;d with storms:</p>

		`<p class="cantohead">Canto V</p>

		<p>FROM the first circle I descended thus</p>
		<p>Down to the second, which, a lesser space</p>

		<div class="stanza">
		<p>Gives sentence, and dismisses them beneath,</p>

		<p>Of sins, considering what place in hell</p>

		<div class="stanza">
		<p>&ldquo;O thou! who to this residence of woe</p>

		<p>Now am I come where many a plaining voice</p>
		<p>Smites on mine ear. Into a place I came</p>
		<p>Where light was silent all. Bellowing there groan&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>A noise as of a sea in tempest torn</p>
		<p>By warring winds. The stormy blast of hell</p>

		<div class="stanza">

		<div class="stanza">
		<p>I understood that to this torment sad</p>

		<p>On this side and on that, above, below,</p>
		<p>It drives them: hope of rest to solace them</p>
		<p>Is none, nor e&rsquo;en of milder pang. As cranes,</p>
		<p>Chanting their dol&rsquo;rous notes, traverse the sky,</p>
		<p>Stretch&rsquo;d out in long array: so I beheld</p>
		<p>Spirits, who came loud wailing, hurried on</p>

		<p>&ldquo;O wearied spirits! come, and hold discourse</p>
		<p>With us, if by none else restrain&rsquo;d.&rdquo; As doves</p>
		<p>By fond desire invited, on wide wings</p>

		<p>Thus issu&rsquo;d from that troop, where Dido ranks,</p>

		<p>If thou art bent to know the primal root,</p>
		<p>From whence our love gat being, I will do,</p>
		<p>As one, who weeps and tells his tale. One day</p>
		<p>For our delight we read of Lancelot,</p>
		<p>How him love thrall&rsquo;d. Alone we were, and no</p>
		<p>Suspicion near us. Ofttimes by that reading</p>
		<p>Our eyes were drawn together, and the hue</p>
		<p>Fled from our alter&rsquo;d cheek. But at one point</p>
		<p>Alone we fell. When of that smile we read,</p>
		<p>The wished smile, rapturously kiss&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>By one so deep in love, then he, who ne&rsquo;er</p>
		<p>From me shall separate, at once my lips</p>
		<p>All trembling kiss&rsquo;d. The book and writer both</p>
		<p>Were love&rsquo;s purveyors. In its leaves that day</p>
		<p>We read no more.&rdquo; While thus one spirit spake,</p>
		<p>The other wail&rsquo;d so sorely, that heartstruck</p>
		<p>I through compassion fainting, seem&rsquo;d not far</p>
		<p>From death, and like a corpse fell to the ground.</p>

		<p>Were wont to name me Ciacco. For the sin</p>
		<p>Of glutt&rsquo;ny, damned vice, beneath this rain,</p>
		<p>e&rsquo;en as thou see&rsquo;st, I with fatigue am worn;</p>
		<p>Nor I sole spirit in this woe: all these</p>
		<p>Have by like crime incurr&rsquo;d like punishment.&rdquo;</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>No more he said, and I my speech resum&rsquo;d:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Ciacco! thy dire affliction grieves me much,</p>
		<p>Even to tears. But tell me, if thou know&rsquo;st,</p>
		<p>What shall at length befall the citizens</p>

		<p>Inhabit there: and tell me of the cause,</p>
		<p>Whence jarring discord hath assail&rsquo;d it thus?&rdquo;</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>He then: &ldquo;After long striving they will come</p>
		<p>To blood; and the wild party from the woods</p>

		<p>Then it behoves, that this must fall, within</p>
		<p>Three solar circles; and the other rise</p>
		<p>By borrow&rsquo;d force of one, who under shore</p>
		<p>Now rests. It shall a long space hold aloof</p>
		<p>Its forehead, keeping under heavy weight</p>
		<p>The other oppress&rsquo;d, indignant at the load,</p>
		<p>And grieving sore. The just are two in number,</p>
		<p>But they neglected. Av&rsquo;rice, envy, pride,</p>
		<p>Three fatal sparks, have set the hearts of all</p>
		<p>On fire.&rdquo; Here ceas&rsquo;d the lamentable sound;</p>
		<p>And I continu&rsquo;d thus: &ldquo;Still would I learn</p>
		<p>More from thee, farther parley still entreat.</p>
		<p>Of Farinata and Tegghiaio say,</p>
		<p>They who so well deserv&rsquo;d, of Giacopo,</p>
		<p>Arrigo, Mosca, and the rest, who bent</p>
		<p>Their minds on working good. Oh! tell me where</p>
		<p>They bide, and to their knowledge let me come.</p>
		<p>For I am press&rsquo;d with keen desire to hear,</p>
		<p>If heaven&rsquo;s sweet cup or poisonous drug of hell</p>
		<p>Be to their lip assign&rsquo;d.&rdquo; He answer&rsquo;d straight:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;These are yet blacker spirits. Various crimes</p>

		<p>If thou so far descendest, thou mayst see them.</p>
		<p>But to the pleasant world when thou return&rsquo;st,</p>

		<p>No more I tell thee, answer thee no more.&rdquo;</p>

		<p>This said, his fixed eyes he turn&rsquo;d askance,</p>

		<p>For thus I question&rsquo;d: &ldquo;Shall these tortures, Sir!</p>

		<p>From one side and the other, with loud voice,</p>
		<p>Both roll&rsquo;d on weights by main forge of their breasts,</p>
		<p>Then smote together, and each one forthwith</p>

		<p>Travers&rsquo;d the horrid circle: then arriv&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Both turn&rsquo;d them round, and through the middle space</p>
		<p>Conflicting met again. At sight whereof</p>
		<p>I, stung with grief, thus spake: &ldquo;O say, my guide!</p>

		<p>On our left hand, all sep&rsquo;rate to the church?&rdquo;</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>He straight replied: &ldquo;In their first life these all</p>
		<p>In mind were so distorted, that they made,</p>
		<p>According to due measure, of their wealth,</p>
		<p>No use. This clearly from their words collect,</p>
		<p>Which they howl forth, at each extremity</p>
		<p>Arriving of the circle, where their crime</p>

		<p>I then: &ldquo;Mid such as these some needs must be,</p>

		<p>The other powers divine. Her changes know</p>
		<p>Nore intermission: by necessity</p>
		<p>She is made swift, so frequent come who claim</p>
		<p>Succession in her favours. This is she,</p>

		<p>With blame requite her, and with evil word;</p>
		<p>But she is blessed, and for that recks not:</p>
		<p>Amidst the other primal beings glad</p>

		<p>Now on our way pass we, to heavier woe</p>
		<p>Descending: for each star is falling now,</p>

		<p>To the next steep, arriving at a well,</p>

		<p>Into a lake, the Stygian nam&rsquo;d, expands</p>
		<p>The dismal stream, when it hath reach&rsquo;d the foot</p>
		<p>Of the grey wither&rsquo;d cliffs. Intent I stood</p>
		<p>To gaze, and in the marish sunk descried</p>
		<p>A miry tribe, all naked, and with looks</p>
		<p>Betok&rsquo;ning rage. They with their hands alone</p>

		<p>The Minotaur; whereat the sage exclaim&rsquo;d:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Run to the passage! while he storms, &rsquo;t is well</p>
		<p>That thou descend.&rdquo; Thus down our road we took</p>
		<p>Through those dilapidated crags, that oft</p>

		<p>Who carried off from Dis the mighty spoil</p>
		<p>Of the highest circle, then through all its bounds</p>
		<p>Such trembling seiz&rsquo;d the deep concave and foul,</p>
		<p>I thought the universe was thrill&rsquo;d with love,</p>

		<p>O foolish wrath! who so dost goad us on</p>
		<p>In the brief life, and in the eternal then</p>
		<p>Thus miserably o&rsquo;erwhelm us. I beheld</p>
		<p>An ample foss, that in a bow was bent,</p>
		<p>As circling all the plain; for so my guide</p>
		<p>Had told. Between it and the rampart&rsquo;s base</p>

		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>At seeing us descend they each one stood;</p>
		<p>And issuing from the troop, three sped with bows</p>
		<p>And missile weapons chosen first; of whom</p>
		<p>One cried from far: &ldquo;Say to what pain ye come</p>

		<div class="stanza">
		<p>Then me he touch&rsquo;d, and spake: &ldquo;Nessus is this,</p>
		<p>Who for the fair Deianira died,</p>

		<p>He in the midst, that on his breast looks down,</p>
		<p>Is the great Chiron who Achilles nurs&rsquo;d;</p>
		<p>That other Pholus, prone to wrath.&rdquo; Around</p>
		<p>The foss these go by thousands, aiming shafts</p>
		<p>At whatsoever spirit dares emerge</p>
		<p>From out the blood, more than his guilt allows.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>We to those beasts, that rapid strode along,</p>
		<p>Drew near, when Chiron took an arrow forth,</p>

		<p>To the cheek-bone, then his great mouth to view</p>
		<p>Exposing, to his fellows thus exclaim&rsquo;d:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Are ye aware, that he who comes behind</p>
		<p>Moves what he touches? The feet of the dead</p>
		<p>Are not so wont.&rdquo; My trusty guide, who now</p>
		<p>Stood near his breast, where the two natures join,</p>
		<p>Thus made reply: &ldquo;He is indeed alive,</p>
		<p>And solitary so must needs by me</p>
		<p>Be shown the gloomy vale, thereto induc&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>By strict necessity, not by delight.</p>
		<p>She left her joyful harpings in the sky,</p>
		<p>Who this new office to my care consign&rsquo;d.</p>
		<p>He is no robber, no dark spirit I.</p>

		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>Then on his right breast turning, Chiron thus</p>
		<p>To Nessus spake: &ldquo;Return, and be their guide.</p>

		<p>I turned me round, and thus he spake; &ldquo;Let him</p>

		<p>&ldquo;A desolate country lies, which Crete is nam&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Under whose monarch in old times the world</p>
		<p>Liv&rsquo;d pure and chaste. A mountain rises there,</p>
		<p>Call&rsquo;d Ida, joyous once with leaves and streams,</p>
		<p>Deserted now like a forbidden thing.</p>
		<p>It was the spot which Rhea, Saturn&rsquo;s spouse,</p>
		<p>Chose for the secret cradle of her son;</p>
		<p>And better to conceal him, drown&rsquo;d in shouts</p>
		<p>His infant cries. Within the mount, upright</p>
		<p>An ancient form there stands and huge, that turns</p>
		<p>His shoulders towards Damiata, and at Rome</p>
		<p>As in his mirror looks. Of finest gold</p>
		<p>His head is shap&rsquo;d, pure silver are the breast</p>
		<p>And arms; thence to the middle is of brass.</p>
		<p>And downward all beneath well-temper&rsquo;d steel,</p>
		<p>Save the right foot of potter&rsquo;s clay, on which</p>
		<p>Than on the other more erect he stands,</p>
		<p>Each part except the gold, is rent throughout;</p>
		<p>And from the fissure tears distil, which join&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Penetrate to that cave. They in their course</p>
		<p>Thus far precipitated down the rock</p>
		<p>Form Acheron, and Styx, and Phlegethon;</p>
		<p>Then by this straiten&rsquo;d channel passing hence</p>
		<p>Beneath, e&rsquo;en to the lowest depth of all,</p>
		<p>Form there Cocytus, of whose lake (thyself</p>
		<p>Shall see it) I here give thee no account.&rdquo;</p>

		<div class="stanza">
		<p>Then I to him: &ldquo;If from our world this sluice</p>
		<p>Be thus deriv&rsquo;d; wherefore to us but now</p>

		<p>&ldquo;The place, thou know&rsquo;st, is round; and though great part</p>
		<p>Thou have already pass&rsquo;d, still to the left</p>
		<p>Descending to the nethermost, not yet</p>

		<p>Wherefore if aught of new to us appear,</p>
		<p>It needs not bring up wonder in thy looks.&rdquo;</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>Then I again inquir&rsquo;d: &ldquo;Where flow the streams</p>
		<p>Of Phlegethon and Lethe? for of one</p>
		<p>Thou tell&rsquo;st not, and the other of that shower,</p>
		<p>Thou say&rsquo;st, is form&rsquo;d.&rdquo; He answer thus return&rsquo;d:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Doubtless thy questions all well pleas&rsquo;d I hear.</p>

		<p>One thou proposest. Lethe thou shalt see,</p>
		<p>But not within this hollow, in the place,</p>
		<p>Whither to lave themselves the spirits go,</p>
		<p>Whose blame hath been by penitence remov&rsquo;d.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>He added: &ldquo;Time is now we quit the wood.</p>
		<p>Look thou my steps pursue: the margins give</p>

		<p>Her dazzling sister&rsquo;s image, but not long</p>
		<p>Her milder sway endures, then riseth up</p>
		<p>The village hind, whom fails his wintry store,</p>

		<p>The world hath chang&rsquo;d its count&rsquo;nance, grasps his crook,</p>
		<p>And forth to pasture drives his little flock:</p>

		<p>Computes his labour&rsquo;s issue, that he seems</p>
		<p>Still to foresee the&rsquo; effect, so lifting me</p>

		<p>We from the bridge&rsquo;s head descended, where</p>
		<p>To the eighth mound it joins, and then the chasm</p>
		<p>Opening to view, I saw a crowd within</p>

		<p>And hideous, that remembrance in my veins</p>
		<p>Yet shrinks the vital current. Of her sands</p>
		<p>Let Lybia vaunt no more: if Jaculus,</p>

		<p>With serpents were their hands behind them bound,</p>
		<p>Which through their reins infix&rsquo;d the tail and head</p>

		<p>And, where the neck is on the shoulders tied,</p>
		<p>Transpierc&rsquo;d him. Far more quickly than e&rsquo;er pen</p>
		<p>Wrote O or I, he kindled, burn&rsquo;d, and chang&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>To ashes, all pour&rsquo;d out upon the earth.</p>
		<p>When there dissolv&rsquo;d he lay, the dust again</p>

		<p>And odorous amomum: swaths of nard</p>
		<p>And myrrh his funeral shroud. As one that falls,</p>
		<p>He knows not how, by force demoniac dragg&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>To earth, or through obstruction fettering up</p>
		<p>In chains invisible the powers of man,</p>

		<p>Upon the reins behind. Ivy ne&rsquo;er clasp&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>A dodder&rsquo;d oak, as round the other&rsquo;s limbs</p>
		<p>The hideous monster intertwin&rsquo;d his own.</p>
		<p>Then, as they both had been of burning wax,</p>
		<p>Each melted into other, mingling hues,</p>
		<p>That which was either now was seen no more.</p>
		<p>Thus up the shrinking paper, ere it burns,</p>
		<p>A brown tint glides, not turning yet to black,</p>
		<p>And the clean white expires. The other two</p>
		<p>Look&rsquo;d on exclaiming: &ldquo;Ah, how dost thou change,</p>
		<p>Agnello! See! Thou art nor double now,</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>&ldquo;Nor only one.&rdquo; The two heads now became</p>
		<p>One, and two figures blended in one form</p>
		<p>Appear&rsquo;d, where both were lost. Of the four lengths</p>
		<p>Two arms were made: the belly and the chest</p>
		<p>The thighs and legs into such members chang&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>As never eye hath seen. Of former shape</p>
		<p>All trace was vanish&rsquo;d. Two yet neither seem&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>That image miscreate, and so pass&rsquo;d on</p>
		<p>With tardy steps. As underneath the scourge</p>
		<p>Of the fierce dog-star, that lays bare the fields,</p>
		<p>Shifting from brake to brake, the lizard seems</p>
		<p>A flash of lightning, if he thwart the road,</p>
		<p>So toward th&rsquo; entrails of the other two</p>
		<p>Approaching seem&rsquo;d, an adder all on fire,</p>
		<p>As the dark pepper-grain, livid and swart.</p>
		<p>In that part, whence our life is nourish&rsquo;d first,</p>
		<p>One he transpierc&rsquo;d; then down before him fell</p>
		<p>Stretch&rsquo;d out. The pierced spirit look&rsquo;d on him</p>
		<p>But spake not; yea stood motionless and yawn&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>As if by sleep or fev&rsquo;rous fit assail&rsquo;d.</p>
		<p>He ey&rsquo;d the serpent, and the serpent him.</p>
		<p>One from the wound, the other from the mouth</p>
		<p>Breath&rsquo;d a thick smoke, whose vap&rsquo;ry columns join&rsquo;d.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>Lucan in mute attention now may hear,</p>

		<p>Cadmus and Arethusa, to a snake</p>
		<p>Him chang&rsquo;d, and her into a fountain clear,</p>
		<p>I envy not; for never face to face</p>
		<p>Two natures thus transmuted did he sing,</p>
		<p>Wherein both shapes were ready to assume</p>
		<p>The other&rsquo;s substance. They in mutual guise</p>
		<p>So answer&rsquo;d, that the serpent split his train</p>
		<p>Divided to a fork, and the pierc&rsquo;d spirit</p>
		<p>Drew close his steps together, legs and thighs</p>
		<p>Compacted, that no sign of juncture soon</p>
		<p>Was visible: the tail disparted took</p>
		<p>The figure which the spirit lost, its skin</p>
		<p>Soft&rsquo;ning, his indurated to a rind.</p>
		<p>The shoulders next I mark&rsquo;d, that ent&rsquo;ring join&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>The monster&rsquo;s arm-pits, whose two shorter feet</p>
		<p>So lengthen&rsquo;d, as the other&rsquo;s dwindling shrunk.</p>
		<p>The feet behind then twisting up became</p>
		<p>That part that man conceals, which in the wretch</p>
		<p>Was cleft in twain. While both the shadowy smoke</p>
		<p>With a new colour veils, and generates</p>
		<p>Th&rsquo; excrescent pile on one, peeling it off</p>
		<p>From th&rsquo; other body, lo! upon his feet</p>
		<p>One upright rose, and prone the other fell.</p>
		<p>Not yet their glaring and malignant lamps</p>
		<p>Were shifted, though each feature chang&rsquo;d beneath.</p>
		<p>Of him who stood erect, the mounting face</p>
		<p>Retreated towards the temples, and what there</p>
		<p>Superfluous matter came, shot out in ears</p>
		<p>From the smooth cheeks, the rest, not backward dragg&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Of its excess did shape the nose; and swell&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Into due size protuberant the lips.</p>
		<p>He, on the earth who lay, meanwhile extends</p>
		<p>His sharpen&rsquo;d visage, and draws down the ears</p>
		<p>Into the head, as doth the slug his horns.</p>
		<p>His tongue continuous before and apt</p>
		<p>For utt&rsquo;rance, severs; and the other&rsquo;s fork</p>
		<p>Closing unites. That done the smoke was laid.</p>
		<p>The soul, transform&rsquo;d into the brute, glides off,</p>
		<p>Hissing along the vale, and after him</p>
		<p>The other talking sputters; but soon turn&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>His new-grown shoulders on him, and in few</p>
		<p>Thus to another spake: &ldquo;Along this path</p>

		<p>A portal for that goodly seed to pass,</p>
		<p>Which sow&rsquo;d imperial Rome; nor less the guile</p>

		<p>Threw out its voice, and spake: &ldquo;When I escap&rsquo;d</p>

		<p>T&rsquo; explore the world, and search the ways of life,</p>
		<p>Man&rsquo;s evil and his virtue. Forth I sail&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Into the deep illimitable main,</p>
		<p>With but one bark, and the small faithful band</p>
		<p>That yet cleav&rsquo;d to me. As Iberia far,</p>
		<p>Far as Morocco either shore I saw,</p>
		<p>And the Sardinian and each isle beside</p>

		<p>Appear&rsquo;d a mountain dim, loftiest methought</p>
		<p>Of all I e&rsquo;er beheld. Joy seiz&rsquo;d us straight,</p>
		<p>But soon to mourning changed. From the new land</p>
		<p>A whirlwind sprung, and at her foremost side</p>
		<p>Did strike the vessel. Thrice it whirl&rsquo;d her round</p>

		<p>Nor the next night, until another sun</p>
		<p>Came out upon the world. When a faint beam</p>
		<p>Had to our doleful prison made its way,</p>
		<p>And in four countenances I descry&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>The image of my own, on either hand</p>
		<p>Through agony I bit, and they who thought</p>
		<p>I did it through desire of feeding, rose</p>
		<p>O&rsquo; th&rsquo; sudden, and cried, &lsquo;Father, we should grieve</p>
		<p>Far less, if thou wouldst eat of us: thou gav&rsquo;st</p>
		<p>These weeds of miserable flesh we wear,</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>&rsquo;And do thou strip them off from us again.&rsquo;</p>
		<p>Then, not to make them sadder, I kept down</p>
		<p>My spirit in stillness. That day and the next</p>
		<p>We all were silent. Ah, obdurate earth!</p>
		<p>Why open&rsquo;dst not upon us? When we came</p>
		<p>To the fourth day, then Geddo at my feet</p>
		<p>Outstretch&rsquo;d did fling him, crying, &lsquo;Hast no help</p>
		<p>For me, my father!&rsquo; There he died, and e&rsquo;en</p>
		<p>Plainly as thou seest me, saw I the three</p>
		<p>Fall one by one &rsquo;twixt the fifth day and sixth:</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>&ldquo;Whence I betook me now grown blind to grope</p>
		<p>Over them all, and for three days aloud</p>
		<p>Call&rsquo;d on them who were dead. Then fasting got</p>
		<p>The mastery of grief.&rdquo; Thus having spoke,</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>Once more upon the wretched skull his teeth</p>
		<p>He fasten&rsquo;d, like a mastiff&rsquo;s &rsquo;gainst the bone</p>
		<p>Firm and unyielding. Oh thou Pisa! shame</p>
		<p>Of all the people, who their dwelling make</p>
		<p>In that fair region, where th&rsquo; Italian voice</p>
		<p>Is heard, since that thy neighbours are so slack</p>
		<p>To punish, from their deep foundations rise</p>
		<p>Capraia and Gorgona, and dam up</p>
		<p>The mouth of Arno, that each soul in thee</p>
		<p>May perish in the waters! What if fame</p>
		<p>Reported that thy castles were betray&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>By Ugolino, yet no right hadst thou</p>
		<p>To stretch his children on the rack. For them,</p>
		<p>Brigata, Ugaccione, and the pair</p>
		<p>Of gentle ones, of whom my song hath told,</p>
		<p>Their tender years, thou modern Thebes! did make</p>
		<p>Uncapable of guilt. Onward we pass&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Where others skarf&rsquo;d in rugged folds of ice</p>
		<p>Not on their feet were turn&rsquo;d, but each revers&rsquo;d.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>There very weeping suffers not to weep;</p>
		<p>For at their eyes grief seeking passage finds</p>
		<p>Impediment, and rolling inward turns</p>
		<p>For increase of sharp anguish: the first tears</p>
		<p>Hang cluster&rsquo;d, and like crystal vizors show,</p>
		<p>Under the socket brimming all the cup.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>Now though the cold had from my face dislodg&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Each feeling, as &rsquo;t were callous, yet me seem&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Some breath of wind I felt. &ldquo;Whence cometh this,&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Said I, &ldquo;my master? Is not here below</p>
		<p>All vapour quench&rsquo;d?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Thou shalt be speedily,&rdquo;</p>
		<p>He answer&rsquo;d, &ldquo;where thine eye shall tell thee whence</p>
		<p>The cause descrying of this airy shower.&rdquo;</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>Then cried out one in the chill crust who mourn&rsquo;d:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;O souls so cruel! that the farthest post</p>
		<p>Hath been assign&rsquo;d you, from this face remove</p>
		<p>The harden&rsquo;d veil, that I may vent the grief</p>
		<p>Impregnate at my heart, some little space</p>
		<p>Ere it congeal again!&rdquo; I thus replied:</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Say who thou wast, if thou wouldst have mine aid;</p>
		<p>And if I extricate thee not, far down</p>
		<p>As to the lowest ice may I descend!&rdquo;</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>&ldquo;The friar Alberigo,&rdquo; answered he,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Am I, who from the evil garden pluck&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Its fruitage, and am here repaid, the date</p>
		<p>More luscious for my fig.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Hah!&rdquo; I exclaim&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Art thou too dead!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;How in the world aloft</p>
		<p>It fareth with my body,&rdquo; answer&rsquo;d he,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;I am right ignorant. Such privilege</p>
		<p>Hath Ptolomea, that ofttimes the soul</p>
		<p>Drops hither, ere by Atropos divorc&rsquo;d.</p>
		<p>And that thou mayst wipe out more willingly</p>
		<p>The glazed tear-drops that o&rsquo;erlay mine eyes,</p>
		<p>Know that the soul, that moment she betrays,</p>
		<p>As I did, yields her body to a fiend</p>
		<p>Who after moves and governs it at will,</p>
		<p>Till all its time be rounded; headlong she</p>
		<p>Falls to this cistern. And perchance above</p>
		<p>Doth yet appear the body of a ghost,</p>
		<p>Who here behind me winters. Him thou know&rsquo;st,</p>
		<p>If thou but newly art arriv&rsquo;d below.</p>
		<p>The years are many that have pass&rsquo;d away,</p>
		<p>Since to this fastness Branca Doria came.&rdquo;</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; answer&rsquo;d I, &ldquo;methinks thou mockest me,</p>
		<p>For Branca Doria never yet hath died,</p>
		<p>But doth all natural functions of a man,</p>
		<p>Eats, drinks, and sleeps, and putteth raiment on.&rdquo;</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>He thus: &ldquo;Not yet unto that upper foss</p>
		<p>By th&rsquo; evil talons guarded, where the pitch</p>
		<p>Tenacious boils, had Michael Zanche reach&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>When this one left a demon in his stead</p>
		<p>In his own body, and of one his kin,</p>
		<p>Who with him treachery wrought. But now put forth</p>
		<p>Thy hand, and ope mine eyes.&rdquo; I op&rsquo;d them not.</p>
		<p>Ill manners were best courtesy to him.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>Ah Genoese! men perverse in every way,</p>
		<p>With every foulness stain&rsquo;d, why from the earth</p>
		<p>Are ye not cancel&rsquo;d? Such an one of yours</p>
		<p>I with Romagna&rsquo;s darkest spirit found,</p>
		<p>As for his doings even now in soul</p>
		<p>Is in Cocytus plung&rsquo;d, and yet doth seem</p>

		`<p class="cantohead">Canto XXXIV</p>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>&ldquo;THE banners of Hell&rsquo;s Monarch do come forth</p>
		<p>Towards us; therefore look,&rdquo; so spake my guide,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;If thou discern him.&rdquo; As, when breathes a cloud</p>
		<p>Heavy and dense, or when the shades of night</p>
		<p>Fall on our hemisphere, seems view&rsquo;d from far</p>
		<p>A windmill, which the blast stirs briskly round,</p>
		<p>Such was the fabric then methought I saw,</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>To shield me from the wind, forthwith I drew</p>
		<p>Behind my guide: no covert else was there.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>Now came I (and with fear I bid my strain</p>
		<p>Record the marvel) where the souls were all</p>
		<p>Whelm&rsquo;d underneath, transparent, as through glass</p>
		<p>Pellucid the frail stem. Some prone were laid,</p>
		<p>Others stood upright, this upon the soles,</p>
		<p>That on his head, a third with face to feet</p>
		<p>Arch&rsquo;d like a bow. When to the point we came,</p>
		<p>Whereat my guide was pleas&rsquo;d that I should see</p>
		<p>The creature eminent in beauty once,</p>
		<p>He from before me stepp&rsquo;d and made me pause.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>&ldquo;Lo!&rdquo; he exclaim&rsquo;d, &ldquo;lo Dis! and lo the place,</p>
		<p>Where thou hast need to arm thy heart with strength.&rdquo;</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>How frozen and how faint I then became,</p>
		<p>Ask me not, reader! for I write it not,</p>
		<p>Since words would fail to tell thee of my state.</p>
		<p>I was not dead nor living. Think thyself</p>
		<p>If quick conception work in thee at all,</p>
		<p>How I did feel. That emperor, who sways</p>
		<p>The realm of sorrow, at mid breast from th&rsquo; ice</p>
		<p>Stood forth; and I in stature am more like</p>
		<p>A giant, than the giants are in his arms.</p>
		<p>Mark now how great that whole must be, which suits</p>
		<p>With such a part. If he were beautiful</p>
		<p>As he is hideous now, and yet did dare</p>
		<p>To scowl upon his Maker, well from him</p>
		<p>May all our mis&rsquo;ry flow. Oh what a sight!</p>
		<p>How passing strange it seem&rsquo;d, when I did spy</p>
		<p>Upon his head three faces: one in front</p>
		<p>Of hue vermilion, th&rsquo; other two with this</p>
		<p>Midway each shoulder join&rsquo;d and at the crest;</p>
		<p>The right &rsquo;twixt wan and yellow seem&rsquo;d: the left</p>
		<p>To look on, such as come from whence old Nile</p>
		<p>Stoops to the lowlands. Under each shot forth</p>
		<p>Two mighty wings, enormous as became</p>
		<p>A bird so vast. Sails never such I saw</p>
		<p>Outstretch&rsquo;d on the wide sea. No plumes had they,</p>
		<p>But were in texture like a bat, and these</p>
		<p>He flapp&rsquo;d i&rsquo; th&rsquo; air, that from him issued still</p>
		<p>Three winds, wherewith Cocytus to its depth</p>
		<p>Was frozen. At six eyes he wept: the tears</p>
		<p>Adown three chins distill&rsquo;d with bloody foam.</p>
		<p>At every mouth his teeth a sinner champ&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Bruis&rsquo;d as with pond&rsquo;rous engine, so that three</p>
		<p>Were in this guise tormented. But far more</p>
		<p>Than from that gnawing, was the foremost pang&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>By the fierce rending, whence ofttimes the back</p>
		<p>Was stript of all its skin. &ldquo;That upper spirit,</p>
		<p>Who hath worse punishment,&rdquo; so spake my guide,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;Is Judas, he that hath his head within</p>
		<p>And plies the feet without. Of th&rsquo; other two,</p>
		<p>Whose heads are under, from the murky jaw</p>
		<p>Who hangs, is Brutus: lo! how he doth writhe</p>
		<p>And speaks not! Th&rsquo; other Cassius, that appears</p>
		<p>So large of limb. But night now re-ascends,</p>
		<p>And it is time for parting. All is seen.&rdquo;</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>I clipp&rsquo;d him round the neck, for so he bade;</p>
		<p>And noting time and place, he, when the wings</p>
		<p>Enough were op&rsquo;d, caught fast the shaggy sides,</p>
		<p>And down from pile to pile descending stepp&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Between the thick fell and the jagged ice.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>Soon as he reach&rsquo;d the point, whereat the thigh</p>
		<p>Upon the swelling of the haunches turns,</p>
		<p>My leader there with pain and struggling hard</p>
		<p>Turn&rsquo;d round his head, where his feet stood before,</p>
		<p>And grappled at the fell, as one who mounts,</p>
		<p>That into hell methought we turn&rsquo;d again.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>&ldquo;Expect that by such stairs as these,&rdquo; thus spake</p>
		<p>The teacher, panting like a man forespent,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;We must depart from evil so extreme.&rdquo;</p>
		<p>Then at a rocky opening issued forth,</p>
		<p>And plac&rsquo;d me on a brink to sit, next join&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>With wary step my side. I rais&rsquo;d mine eyes,</p>
		<p>Believing that I Lucifer should see</p>
		<p>Where he was lately left, but saw him now</p>
		<p>With legs held upward. Let the grosser sort,</p>
		<p>Who see not what the point was I had pass&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>Bethink them if sore toil oppress&rsquo;d me then.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
		<p>&ldquo;Arise,&rdquo; my master cried, &ldquo;upon thy feet.</p>
		<p>The way is long, and much uncouth the road;</p>
		<p>And now within one hour and half of noon</p>
		<p>The sun returns.&rdquo; It was no palace-hall</p>
		<p>Lofty and luminous wherein we stood,</p>
		<p>But natural dungeon where ill footing was</p>
		<p>And scant supply of light. &ldquo;Ere from th&rsquo; abyss</p>
		<p>I sep&rsquo;rate,&rdquo; thus when risen I began,</p>
		<p>&ldquo;My guide! vouchsafe few words to set me free</p>
		<p>From error&rsquo;s thralldom. Where is now the ice?</p>
		<p>How standeth he in posture thus revers&rsquo;d?</p>
		<p>And how from eve to morn in space so brief</p>
		<p>Hath the sun made his transit?&rdquo; He in few</p>
		<p>Thus answering spake: &ldquo;Thou deemest thou art still</p>
		<p>On th&rsquo; other side the centre, where I grasp&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Th&rsquo; abhorred worm, that boreth through the world.</p>
		<p>Thou wast on th&rsquo; other side, so long as I</p>
		<p>Descended; when I turn&rsquo;d, thou didst o&rsquo;erpass</p>
		<p>That point, to which from ev&rsquo;ry part is dragg&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>All heavy substance. Thou art now arriv&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>Under the hemisphere opposed to that,</p>
		<p>Which the great continent doth overspread,</p>
		<p>And underneath whose canopy expir&rsquo;d</p>
		<p>The Man, that was born sinless, and so liv&rsquo;d.</p>
		<p>Thy feet are planted on the smallest sphere,</p>
		<p>Whose other aspect is Judecca. Morn</p>
		<p>Here rises, when there evening sets: and he,</p>
		<p>Whose shaggy pile was scal&rsquo;d, yet standeth fix&rsquo;d,</p>
		<p>As at the first. On this part he fell down</p>
		<p>From heav&rsquo;n; and th&rsquo; earth, here prominent before,</p>
		<p>Through fear of him did veil her with the sea,</p>
		<p>And to our hemisphere retir&rsquo;d. Perchance</p>
		<p>To shun him was the vacant space left here</p>
		<p>By what of firm land on this side appears,</p>
		<p>That sprang aloof.&rdquo; There is a place beneath,</p>
		<p>From Belzebub as distant, as extends</p>
		<p>The vaulted tomb, discover&rsquo;d not by sight,</p>
		<p>But by the sound of brooklet, that descends</p>
		<p>This way along the hollow of a rock,</p>
		<p>Which, as it winds with no precipitous course,</p>
		<p>The wave hath eaten. By that hidden way</p>
		<p>My guide and I did enter, to return</p>
		<p>To the fair world: and heedless of repose</p>
		<p>We climbed, he first, I following his steps,</p>
		<p>Till on our view the beautiful lights of heav&rsquo;n</p>
		<p>Dawn&rsquo;d through a circular opening in the cave:</p>
		<p>Thus issuing we again beheld the stars.</p>
