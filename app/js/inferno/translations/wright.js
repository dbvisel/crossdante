		`<p class="cantohead">Canto I</p>
		<div class="stanza">
			<p>ONE night, when half my life behind me lay,</p>
			<p>I wandered from the straight lost path afar.</p>
			<p>Through the great dark was no releasing way;</p>
			<p>Above that dark was no relieving star.</p>
			<p>If yet that terrored night I think or say,</p>
			<p>As death&rsquo;s cold hands its fears resuming are.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
			<p>Gladly the dreads I felt, too dire to tell,</p>
			<p>The hopeless, pathless, lightless hours forgot,</p>
			<p>I turn my tale to that which next befell,</p>
			<p>When the dawn opened, and the night was not.</p>
			<p>The hollowed blackness of that waste, God wot,</p>
			<p>Shrank, thinned, and ceased. A blinding splendour hot</p>
			<p>Flushed the great height toward which my footsteps fell,</p>
			<p>And though it kindled from the nether hell,</p>
			<p>Or from the Star that all men leads, alike</p>
			<p>It showed me where the great dawn-glories strike</p>
			<p>The wide east, and the utmost peaks of snow.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
			<p>How first I entered on that path astray,</p>
			<p>Beset with sleep, I know not. This I know.</p>
			<p>When gained my feet the upward, lighted way,</p>
			<p>I backward gazed, as one the drowning sea,</p>
			<p>The deep strong tides, has baffled, and panting lies,</p>
			<p>On the shelved shore, and turns his eyes to see</p>
			<p>The league-wide wastes that held him. So mine eyes</p>
			<p>Surveyed that fear, the while my wearied frame</p>
			<p>Rested, and ever my heart&rsquo;s tossed lake became</p>
			<p>More quiet.</p>
			<p>Then from that pass released, which yet</p>
			<p>With living feet had no man left, I set</p>
			<p>My forward steps aslant the steep, that so,</p>
			<p>My right foot still the lower, I climbed.</p>
			<p class="slindent8em">Below</p>
			<p>No more I gazed. Around, a slope of sand</p>
			<p>Was sterile of all growth on either hand,</p>
			<p>Or moving life, a spotted pard except,</p>
			<p>That yawning rose, and stretched, and purred and leapt</p>
			<p>So closely round my feet, that scarce I kept</p>
			<p>The course I would.</p>
			<p class="slindent4em">That sleek and lovely thing,</p>
			<p>The broadening light, the breath of morn and spring,</p>
			<p>The sun, that with his stars in Aries lay,</p>
			<p>As when Divine Love on Creation&rsquo;s day</p>
			<p>First gave these fair things motion, all at one</p>
			<p>Made lightsome hope; but lightsome hope was none</p>
			<p>When down the slope there came with lifted head</p>
			<p>And back-blown mane and caverned mouth and red,</p>
			<p>A lion, roaring, all the air ashake</p>
			<p>That heard his hunger. Upward flight to take</p>
			<p>No heart was mine, for where the further way</p>
			<p>Mine anxious eyes explored, a she-wolf lay,</p>
			<p>That licked lean flanks, and waited. Such was she</p>
			<p>In aspect ruthless that I quaked to see,</p>
			<p>And where she lay among her bones had brought</p>
			<p>So many to grief before, that all my thought</p>
			<p>Aghast turned backward to the sunless night</p>
			<p>I left. But while I plunged in headlong flight</p>
			<p>To that most feared before, a shade, or man</p>
			<p>(Either he seemed), obstructing where I ran,</p>
			<p>Called to me with a voice that few should know,</p>
			<p>Faint from forgetful silence, &ldquo;Where ye go,</p>
			<p>Take heed. Why turn ye from the upward way?&rdquo;</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
			<p>I cried, &ldquo;Or come ye from warm earth, or they</p>
			<p>The grave hath taken, in my mortal need</p>
			<p>Have mercy thou!&rdquo;</p>
			<p class="slindent4em">He answered, &ldquo;Shade am I,</p>
			<p>That once was man; beneath the Lombard sky,</p>
			<p>In the late years of Julius born, and bred</p>
			<p>In Mantua, till my youthful steps were led</p>
			<p>To Rome, where yet the false gods lied to man;</p>
			<p>And when the great Augustan age began,</p>
			<p>I wrote the tale of Ilium burnt, and how</p>
			<p>Anchises&rsquo; son forth-pushed a venturous prow,</p>
			<p>Seeking unknown seas. But in what mood art thou</p>
			<p>To thus return to all the ills ye fled,</p>
			<p>The while the mountain of thy hope ahead</p>
			<p>Lifts into light, the source and cause of all</p>
			<p>Delectable things that may to man befall?&rdquo;</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
			<p>I answered, &ldquo;Art thou then that Virgil, he</p>
			<p>From whom all grace of measured speech in me</p>
			<p>Derived? O glorious and far-guiding star!</p>
			<p>Now may the love-led studious hours and long</p>
			<p>In which I learnt how rich thy wonders are,</p>
			<p>Master and Author mine of Light and Song,</p>
			<p>Befriend me now, who knew thy voice, that few</p>
			<p>Yet hearken. All the name my work hath won</p>
			<p>Is thine of right, from whom I learned. To thee,</p>
			<p>Abashed, I grant it. . . Why the mounting sun</p>
			<p>No more I seek, ye scarce should ask, who see</p>
			<p>The beast that turned me, nor faint hope have I</p>
			<p>To force that passage if thine aid deny.&ldquo;</p>
			<p>He answered, &ldquo;Would ye leave this wild and live,</p>
			<p>Strange road is ours, for where the she-wolf lies</p>
			<p>Shall no man pass, except the path he tries</p>
			<p>Her craft entangle. No way fugitive</p>
			<p>Avoids the seeking of her greeds, that give</p>
			<p>Insatiate hunger, and such vice perverse</p>
			<p>As makes her leaner while she feeds, and worse</p>
			<p>Her craving. And the beasts with which she breed</p>
			<p>The noisome numerous beasts her lusts require,</p>
			<p>Bare all the desirable lands in which she feeds;</p>
			<p>Nor shall lewd feasts and lewder matings tire</p>
			<p>Until she woos, in evil hour for her,</p>
			<p>The wolfhound that shall rend her. His desire</p>
			<p>Is not for rapine, as the promptings stir</p>
			<p>Of her base heart; but wisdoms, and devoirs</p>
			<p>Of manhood, and love&rsquo;s rule, his thoughts prefer.</p>
			<p>The Italian lowlands he shall reach and save,</p>
			<p>For which Camilla of old, the virgin brave,</p>
			<p>Turnus and Nisus died in strife. His chase</p>
			<p>He shall not cease, nor any cowering-place</p>
			<p>Her fear shall find her, till he drive her back,</p>
			<p>From city to city exiled, from wrack to wrack</p>
			<p>Slain out of life, to find the native hell</p>
			<p>Whence envy loosed her.</p>
			<p class="slindent6em">For thyself were well</p>
			<p>To follow where I lead, and thou shalt see</p>
			<p>The spirits in pain, and hear the hopeless woe,</p>
			<p>The unending cries, of those whose only plea</p>
			<p>Is judgment, that the second death to be</p>
			<p>Fall quickly. Further shalt thou climb, and go</p>
			<p>To those who burn, but in their pain content</p>
			<p>With hope of pardon; still beyond, more high,</p>
			<p>Holier than opens to such souls as I,</p>
			<p>The Heavens uprear; but if thou wilt, is one</p>
			<p>Worthier, and she shall guide thee there, where none</p>
			<p>Who did the Lord of those fair realms deny</p>
			<p>May enter. There in his city He dwells, and there</p>
			<p>Rules and pervades in every part, and calls</p>
			<p>His chosen ever within the sacred walls.</p>
			<p>O happiest, they!&rdquo;</p>
			<p class="slindent4em">I answered, &ldquo;By that God</p>
			<p>Thou didst not know, I do thine aid entreat,</p>
			<p>And guidance, that beyond the ills I meet</p>
			<p>I safety find, within the Sacred Gate</p>
			<p>That Peter guards, and those sad souls to see</p>
			<p>Who look with longing for their end to be.&rdquo;</p>

		`<p class="cantohead">Canto II</p>
		<div class="stanza">
			<p>THE day was falling, and the darkening air</p>
			<p>Released earth&rsquo;s creatures from their toils, while I,</p>
			<p>I only, faced the bitter road and bare</p>
			<p>My Master led. I only, must defy</p>
			<p>The powers of pity, and the night to be.</p>
			<p>So thought I, but the things I came to see,</p>
			<p>Which memory holds, could never thought forecast.</p>
			<p>O Muses high! O Genius, first and last!</p>
			<p>Memories intense! Your utmost powers combine</p>
			<p>To meet this need. For never theme as mine</p>
			<p>Strained vainly, where your loftiest nobleness</p>
			<p>Must fail to be sufficient.</p>
			<p class="slindent10em">First I said,</p>
			<p>Fearing, to him who through the darkness led,</p>
			<p>&ldquo;O poet, ere the arduous path ye press</p>
			<p>Too far, look in me, if the worth there be</p>
			<p>To make this transit. &AElig;neas once, I know,</p>
			<p>Went down in life, and crossed the infernal sea;</p>
			<p>And if the Lord of All Things Lost Below</p>
			<p>Allowed it, reason seems, to those who see</p>
			<p>The enduring greatness of his destiny,</p>
			<p>Who in the Empyrean Heaven elect was called</p>
			<p>Sire of the Eternal City, that throned and walled</p>
			<p>Made Empire of the world beyond, to be</p>
			<p>The Holy Place at last, by God&rsquo;s decree,</p>
			<p>Where the great Peter&rsquo;s follower rules. For he</p>
			<p>Learned there the causes of his victory.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
			<p>&ldquo;And later to the third great Heaven was caught</p>
			<p>The last Apostle, and thence returning brought</p>
			<p>The proofs of our salvation. But, for me,</p>
			<p>I am not &AElig;neas, nay, nor Paul, to see</p>
			<p>Unspeakable things that depths or heights can show,</p>
			<p>And if this road for no sure end I go</p>
			<p>What folly is mine? But any words are weak.</p>
			<p>Thy wisdom further than the things I speak</p>
			<p>Can search the event that would be.&rdquo;</p>
			<p class="slindent10em">Here I stayed</p>
			<p>My steps amid the darkness, and the Shade</p>
			<p>That led me heard and turned, magnanimous,</p>
			<p>And saw me drained of purpose halting thus,</p>
			<p>And answered, &ldquo;If thy coward-born thoughts be clear,</p>
			<p>And all thy once intent, infirmed of fear,</p>
			<p>Broken, then art thou as scared beasts that shy</p>
			<p>From shadows, surely that they know not why</p>
			<p>Nor wherefore. . . Hearken, to confound thy fear,</p>
			<p>The things which first I heard, and brought me here.</p>
			<p>One came where, in the Outer Place, I dwell,</p>
			<p>Suspense from hope of Heaven or fear of Hell,</p>
			<p>Radiant in light that native round her clung,</p>
			<p>And cast her eyes our hopeless Shades among</p>
			<p>(Eyes with no earthly like but heaven&rsquo;s own blue),</p>
			<p>And called me to her in such voice as few</p>
			<p>In that grim place had heard, so low, so clear,</p>
			<p>So toned and cadenced from the Utmost Sphere,</p>
			<p>The Unattainable Heaven from which she came.</p>
			<p>&lsquo;O Mantuan Spirit,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;whose lasting fame</p>
			<p>Continues on the earth ye left, and still</p>
			<p>With Time shall stand, an earthly friend to me,</p>
			<p>- My friend, not fortune&rsquo;s&nbsp;&ndash; climbs a path so ill</p>
			<p>That all the night-bred fears he hastes to flee</p>
			<p>Were kindly to the thing he nears. The tale</p>
			<p>Moved through the peace of I leaven, and swift I sped</p>
			<p>Downward, to aid my friend in love&rsquo;s avail,</p>
			<p>With scanty time therefor, that half I dread</p>
			<p>Too late I came. But thou shalt haste, and go</p>
			<p>With golden wisdom of thy speech, that so</p>
			<p>For me be consolation. Thou shalt say,</p>
			<p>&ldquo;I come from Beatricë.&rdquo; Downward far,</p>
			<p>From Heaven to I leaven I sank, from star to star,</p>
			<p>To find thee, and to point his rescuing way.</p>
			<p>Fain would I to my place of light return;</p>
			<p>Love moved me from it, and gave me power to learn</p>
			<p>Thy speech. When next before my Lord I stand</p>
			<p>I very oft shall praise thee.&rsquo;</p>
			<p class="slindent10em">Here she ceased,</p>
			<p>And I gave answer to that dear command,</p>
			<p>&lsquo;Lady, alone through whom the whole race of those</p>
			<p>The smallest Heaven the moon&rsquo;s short orbits hold</p>
			<p>Excels in its creation, not thy least,</p>
			<p>Thy lightest wish in this dark realm were told</p>
			<p>Vainly. But show me why the Heavens unclose</p>
			<p>To loose thee from them, and thyself content</p>
			<p>Couldst thus continue in such strange descent</p>
			<p>From that most Spacious Place for which ye burn,</p>
			<p>And while ye further left, would fain return.&rsquo;</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
			<p>&ldquo; &lsquo;That which thou wouldst,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I briefly tell.</p>
			<p>There is no fear nor any hurt in Hell,</p>
			<p>Except that it be powerful. God in me</p>
			<p>Is gracious, that the piteous sights I see</p>
			<p>I share not, nor myself can shrink to feel</p>
			<p>The flame of all this burning. One there is</p>
			<p>In height among the Holiest placed, and she</p>
			<p>- Mercy her name&nbsp;&ndash; among God&rsquo;s mysteries</p>
			<p>Dwells in the midst, and hath the power to see</p>
			<p>His judgments, and to break them. This sharp</p>
			<p>I tell thee, when she saw, she called, that so</p>
			<p>Leaned Lucia toward her while she spake&nbsp;&ndash; and said,</p>
			<p>&ldquo;One that is faithful to thy name is sped,</p>
			<p>Except that now ye aid him.&rdquo; She thereat,</p>
			<p>&ndash;&nbsp;Lucia, to all men&rsquo;s wrongs inimical -</p>
			<p>Left her High Place, and crossed to where I sat</p>
			<p>In speech with Rachel (of the first of all</p>
			<p>God saved). &ldquo;O Beatrice, Praise of God,&rdquo;</p>
			<p>- So said she to me&nbsp;&ndash; &ldquo;sitt&rsquo;st thou here so slow</p>
			<p>To aid him, once on earth that loved thee so</p>
			<p>That all he left to serve thee? Hear&rsquo;st thou not</p>
			<p>The anguish of his plaint? and dost not see,</p>
			<p>By that dark stream that never seeks a sea,</p>
			<p>The death that threats him?&rdquo;</p>
			<p class="slindent8em">None, as thus she said,</p>
			<p>None ever was swift on earth his good to chase,</p>
			<p>None ever on earth was swift to leave his dread,</p>
			<p>As came I downward from that sacred place</p>
			<p>To find thee and invoke thee, confident</p>
			<p>Not vainly for his need the gold were spent</p>
			<p>Of thy word-wisdom.&rsquo; Here she turned away,</p>
			<p>Her bright eyes clouded with their tears, and I,</p>
			<p>Who saw them, therefore made more haste to reach</p>
			<p>The place she told, and found thee. Canst thou say</p>
			<p>I failed thy rescue? Is the beast anigh</p>
			<p>From which ye quailed? When such dear saints beseech</p>
			<p>&ndash;&nbsp;Three from the Highest&nbsp;&ndash; that Heaven thy course allow</p>
			<p>Why halt ye fearful? In such guards as thou</p>
			<p>The faintest-hearted might be bold.&rdquo;</p>
			<p class="slindent14em">As flowers,</p>
			<p>Close-folded through the cold and lightless hours,</p>
			<p>Their bended stems erect, and opening fair</p>
			<p>Accept the white light and the warmer air</p>
			<p>Of morning, so my fainting heart anew</p>
			<p>Lifted, that heard his comfort. Swift I spake,</p>
			<p>&ldquo;O courteous thou, and she compassionate!</p>
			<p>Thy haste that saved me, and her warning true,</p>
			<p>Beyond my worth exalt me. Thine I make</p>
			<p>My will. In concord of one mind from now,</p>
			<p>O Master and my Guide, where leadest thou</p>
			<p>I follow.&rdquo;</p>
			<p class="slindent2em">And we, with no more words&rsquo; delay,</p>
			<p>Went forward on that hard and dreadful way.</p>

		`<p class="cantohead">Canto III</p>
		<div class="stanza">
			<p>THE gateway to the city of Doom. Through me</p>
			<p>The entrance to the Everlasting Pain.</p>
			<p>The Gateway of the Lost. The Eternal Three</p>
			<p>Justice impelled to build me. Here ye see</p>
			<p>Wisdom Supreme at work, and Primal Power,</p>
			<p>And Love Supernal in their dawnless day.</p>
			<p>Ere from their thought creation rose in flower</p>
			<p>Eternal first were all things fixed as they.</p>
			<p>Of Increate Power infinite formed am I</p>
			<p>That deathless as themselves I do not die.</p>
			<p>Justice divine has weighed: the doom is clear.</p>
			<p>All hope renounce, ye lost, who enter here.</p>
			<p>This scroll in gloom above the gate I read,</p>
			<p>And found it fearful. &ldquo;Master, hard,&rdquo; I said,</p>
			<p>&ldquo;This saying to me." And he, as one that long</p>
			<p>Was customed, answered, &ldquo;No distrust must wrong</p>
			<p>Its Maker, nor thy cowarder mood resume</p>
			<p>If here ye enter. This the place of doom</p>
			<p>I told thee, where the lost in darkness dwell.</p>
			<p>Here, by themselves divorced from light, they fell,</p>
			<p>And are as ye shall see them.&rdquo; Here he lent</p>
			<p>A hand to draw me through the gate, and bent</p>
			<p>A glance upon my fear so confident</p>
			<p>That I, too nearly to my former dread</p>
			<p>Returned, through all my heart was comforted,</p>
			<p>And downward to the secret things we went.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
			<p>Downward to night, but not of moon and cloud,</p>
			<p>Not night with all its stars, as night we know,</p>
			<p>But burdened with an ocean-weight of woe</p>
			<p>The darkness closed us.</p>
			<p class="slindent6em">Sighs, and wailings loud,</p>
			<p>Outcries perpetual of recruited pain,</p>
			<p>Sounds of strange tongues, and angers that remain</p>
			<p>Vengeless for ever, the thick and clamorous crowd</p>
			<p>Of discords pressed, that needs I wept to hear,</p>
			<p>First hearing. There, with reach of hands anear,</p>
			<p>And voices passion-hoarse, or shrilled with fright,</p>
			<p>The tumult of the everlasting night,</p>
			<p>As sand that dances in continual wind,</p>
			<p>Turns on itself for ever.</p>
			<p class="slindent8em">And I, my head</p>
			<p>Begirt with movements, and my ears bedinned</p>
			<p>With outcries round me, to my leader said,</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Master, what hear I? Who so overborne</p>
			<p>With woes are these?&rdquo;</p>
			<p class="slindent6em">He answered, &ldquo;These be they</p>
			<p>That praiseless lived and blameless. Now the scorn</p>
			<p>Of Height and Depth alike, abortions drear;</p>
			<p>Cast with those abject angels whose delay</p>
			<p>To join rebellion, or their Lord defend,</p>
			<p>Waiting their proved advantage, flung them here. -</p>
			<p>Chased forth from Heaven, lest else its beauties end</p>
			<p>The pure perfection of their stainless claim,</p>
			<p>Out-herded from the shining gate they came,</p>
			<p>Where the deep hells refused them, lest the lost</p>
			<p>Boast something baser than themselves.&rdquo;</p>
			<p class="slindent14em">And I,</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Master, what grievance hath their failure cost,</p>
			<p>That through the lamentable dark they cry?&rdquo;</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
			<p>He answered, &ldquo;Briefly at a thing not worth</p>
			<p>We glance, and pass forgetful. Hope in death</p>
			<p>They have not. Memory of them on the earth</p>
			<p>Where once they lived remains not. Nor the breath</p>
			<p>Of Justice shall condemn, nor Mercy plead,</p>
			<p>But all alike disdain them. That they know</p>
			<p>Themselves so mean beneath aught else constrains</p>
			<p>The envious outcries that too long ye heed.</p>
			<p>Move past, but speak not.&rdquo;</p>
			<p class="slindent8em">Then I looked, and lo,</p>
			<p>Were souls in ceaseless and unnumbered trains</p>
			<p>That past me whirled unending, vainly led</p>
			<p>Nowhither, in useless and unpausing haste.</p>
			<p>A fluttering ensign all their guide, they chased</p>
			<p>Themselves for ever. I had not thought the dead,</p>
			<p>The whole world&rsquo;s dead, so many as these. I saw</p>
			<p>The shadow of him elect to Peter&rsquo;s seat</p>
			<p>Who made the great refusal, and the law,</p>
			<p>The unswerving law that left them this retreat</p>
			<p>To seal the abortion of their lives, became</p>
			<p>Illumined to me, and themselves I knew,</p>
			<p>To God and all his foes the futile crew</p>
			<p>How hateful in their everlasting shame.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="stanza">
			<p>I saw these victims of continued death</p>
			<p>- For lived they never&nbsp;&ndash; were naked all, and loud</p>
			<p>Around them closed a never-ceasing cloud</p>
			<p>Of hornets and great wasps, that buzzed and clung,</p>
			<p>- Weak pain for weaklings meet,&nbsp;&ndash; and where they stung,</p>
			<p>Blood from their faces streamed, with sobbing breath,</p>
			<p>And all the ground beneath with tears and blood</p>
			<p>Was drenched, and crawling in that loathsome mud</p>
			<p>There were great worms that drank it.</p>
			<p class="slindent10em">Gladly thence</p>
			<p>I gazed far forward. Dark and wide the flood</p>
			<p>That flowed before us. On the nearer shore</p>
			<p>Were people waiting. &ldquo;Master, show me whence</p>
			<p>These came, and who they be, and passing hence</p>
			<p>Where go they? Wherefore wait they there content,</p>
			<p>&ndash;&nbsp;The faint light shows it,&nbsp;&ndash; for their transit o&rsquo;er</p>
			<p>The unbridged abyss?&rdquo;</p>
			<p class="slindent6em">He answered, &ldquo;When we stand</p>
			<p>Together, waiting on the joyless strand,</p>
			<p>In all it shall be told thee.&rdquo; If he meant</p>
			<p>Reproof I know not, but with shame I bent</p>
			<p>My downward eyes, and no more spake until</p>
			<p>The bank we reached, and on the stream beheld</p>
			<p>A bark ply toward us.</p>
			<p class="slindent8em">Of exceeding eld,</p>
			<p>And hoary showed the steersman, screaming shrill,</p>
			<p>With horrid glee the while he neared us, &ldquo;Woe</p>
			<p>To ye, depraved!&nbsp;&ndash; Is here no Heaven, but ill</p>
			<p>The place where I shall herd ye. Ice and fire</p>
			<p>And darkness are the wages of their hire</p>
			<p>Who serve unceasing here&nbsp;&ndash; But thou that there</p>
			<p>Dost wait though live, depart ye. Yea, forbear!</p>
			<p>A different passage and a lighter fare</p>
			<p>Is destined thine.&rdquo;</p>
			<p class="slindent6em">But here my guide replied,</p>
			<p>&ldquo;Nay, Charon, cease; or to thy grief ye chide.</p>
			<p>It There is willed, where that is willed shall be,</p>
			<p>That ye shall pass him to the further side,</p>
			<p>Nor question more.&rdquo;</p>
			<p class="slindent6em">The fleecy cheeks thereat,</p>
			<p>Blown with fierce speech before, were drawn and flat,</p>
			<p>And his flame-circled eyes subdued, to hear</p>
			<p>That mandate given. But those of whom he spake</p>
			<p>In bitter glee, with naked limbs ashake,</p>
			<p>And chattering teeth received it. Seemed that then</p>
			<p>They first were conscious where they came, and fear</p>
			<p>Abject and frightful shook them; curses burst</p>
			<p>In clamorous discords forth; the race of men,</p>
			<p>Their parents, and their God, the place, the time,</p>
			<p>Of their conceptions and their births, accursed</p>
			<p>Alike they called, blaspheming Heaven. But yet</p>
			<p>Slow steps toward the waiting bark they set,</p>
			<p>With terrible wailing while they moved. And so</p>
			<p>They came reluctant to the shore of woe</p>
			<p>That waits for all who fear not God, and not</p>
			<p>Them only.</p>
			<p class="slindent4em">Then the demon Charon rose</p>
			<p>To herd them in, with eyes that furnace-hot</p>
			<p>Glowed at the task, and lifted oar to smite</p>
			<p>Who lingered.</p>
			<p class="slindent4em">As the leaves, when autumn shows,</p>
			<p>One after one descending, leave the bough,</p>
			<p>Or doves come downward to the call, so now</p>
			<p>The evil seed of Adam to endless night,</p>
			<p>As Charon signalled, from the shore&rsquo;s bleak height,</p>
			<p>Cast themselves downward to the bark. The brown</p>
			<p>And bitter flood received them, and while they passed</p>
			<p>Were others gathering, patient as the last,</p>
			<p>Not conscious of their nearing doom.</p>
			<p class="slindent14em">&ldquo;My son,&rdquo;</p>
			<p>&ndash;&nbsp;Replied my guide the unspoken thought&nbsp;&ndash; &ldquo;is none</p>
			<p>Beneath God&rsquo;s wrath who dies in field or town,</p>
			<p>Or earth&rsquo;s wide space, or whom the waters drown,</p>
			<p>But here he cometh at last, and that so spurred</p>
			<p>By Justice, that his fear, as those ye heard,</p>
			<p>Impels him forward like desire. Is not</p>
			<p>One spirit of all to reach the fatal spot</p>
			<p>That God&rsquo;s love holdeth, and hence, if Char</p>
			<p>chide,</p>
			<p>Ye well may take it.&nbsp;&ndash; Raise thy heart, for now,</p>
			<p>Constrained of Heaven, he must thy course allow."</p>

			<p>Yet how I passed I know not. For the ground</p>
			<p>Trembled that heard him, and a fearful sound</p>
			<p>Of issuing wind arose, and blood-red light</p>
			<p>Broke from beneath our feet, and sense and sight</p>
			<p>Left me. The memory with cold sweat once more</p>
			<p>Reminds me of the sudden-crimsoned night,</p>
			<p>As sank I senseless by the dreadful shore.</p>
