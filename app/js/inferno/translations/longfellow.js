	<div class="stanza">
		<p>Midway upon the journey of our life</p>
		<p class="slindent">I found myself within a forest dark,</p>
		<p class="slindent">For the straightforward pathway had been lost.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="stanza">
		<p>Ah me! how hard a thing it is to say</p>
		<p class="slindent">What was this forest savage, rough, and stern,</p>
		<p class="slindent">Which in the very thought renews the fear.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="stanza">
		<p>So bitter is it, death is little more;</p>
		<p class="slindent">But of the good to treat, which there I found,</p>
		<p class="slindent">Speak will I of the other things I saw there.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="stanza">
		<p>I cannot well repeat how there I entered,</p>
		<p class="slindent">So full was I of slumber at the moment</p>
		<p class="slindent">In which I had abandoned the true way.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="stanza">
		<p>But after I had reached a mountain&rsquo;s foot,</p>
		<p class="slindent">At that point where the valley terminated,</p>
		<p class="slindent">Which had with consternation pierced my heart,</p>
	</div>
	<div class="stanza">
		<p>Upward I looked, and I beheld its shoulders,</p>
		<p class="slindent">Vested already with that planet&rsquo;s rays</p>
		<p class="slindent">Which leadeth others right by every road.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="stanza">
		<p>Then was the fear a little quieted</p>
		<p class="slindent">That in my heart&rsquo;s lake had endured throughout</p>
		<p class="slindent">The night, which I had passed so piteously.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="stanza">
		<p>And even as he, who, with distressful breath,</p>
		<p class="slindent">Forth issued from the sea upon the shore,</p>
		<p class="slindent">Turns to the water perilous and gazes;</p>
	</div>
	<div class="stanza">
		<p>So did my soul, that still was fleeing onward,</p>
		<p class="slindent">Turn itself back to re-behold the pass</p>
		<p class="slindent">Which never yet a living person left.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="stanza">
		<p>After my weary body I had rested,</p>
		<p class="slindent">The way resumed I on the desert slope,</p>
		<p class="slindent">So that the firm foot ever was the lower.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="stanza">
		<p>And lo! almost where the ascent began,</p>
		<p class="slindent">A panther light and swift exceedingly,</p>
		<p class="slindent">Which with a spotted skin was covered o&rsquo;er!</p>
	</div>
	<div class="stanza">
		<p>And never moved she from before my face,</p>
		<p class="slindent">Nay, rather did impede so much my way,</p>
		<p class="slindent">That many times I to return had turned.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="stanza">
		<p>The time was the beginning of the morning,</p>
		<p class="slindent">And up the sun was mounting with those stars</p>
		<p class="slindent">That with him were, what time the Love Divine</p>
	</div>
	<div class="stanza">
		<p>At first in motion set those beauteous things;</p>
		<p class="slindent">So were to me occasion of good hope,</p>
		<p class="slindent">The variegated skin of that wild beast,</p>
	</div>
	<div class="stanza">
		<p>The hour of time, and the delicious season;</p>
		<p class="slindent">But not so much, that did not give me fear</p>
		<p class="slindent">A lion&rsquo;s aspect which appeared to me.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="stanza">
		<p>He seemed as if against me he were coming</p>
		<p class="slindent">With head uplifted, and with ravenous hunger,</p>
		<p class="slindent">So that it seemed the air was afraid of him;</p>
	</div>
	<div class="stanza">
		<p>And a she-wolf, that with all hungerings</p>
		<p class="slindent">Seemed to be laden in her meagreness,</p>
		<p class="slindent">And many folk has caused to live forlorn!</p>
	</div>
	<div class="stanza">
		<p>She brought upon me so much heaviness,</p>
		<p class="slindent">With the affright that from her aspect came,</p>
		<p class="slindent">That I the hope relinquished of the height.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="stanza">
		<p>And as he is who willingly acquires,</p>
		<p class="slindent">And the time comes that causes him to lose,</p>
		<p class="slindent">Who weeps in all his thoughts and is despondent,</p>
	</div>
	<div class="stanza">
		<p>E&rsquo;en such made me that beast withouten peace,</p>
		<p class="slindent">Which, coming on against me by degrees</p>
		<p class="slindent">Thrust me back thither where the sun is silent.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="stanza">
		<p>While I was rushing downward to the lowland,</p>
		<p class="slindent">Before mine eyes did one present himself,</p>
		<p class="slindent">Who seemed from long-continued silence hoarse.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="stanza">
		<p>When I beheld him in the desert vast,</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Have pity on me,&rdquo; unto him I cried,</p>
		<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Whiche&rsquo;er thou art, or shade or real man!&rdquo;</p>
	</div>
	<div class="stanza">
		<p>He answered me: &ldquo;Not man; man once I was,</p>
		<p class="slindent">And both my parents were of Lombardy,</p>
		<p class="slindent">And Mantuans by country both of them.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="stanza">
		<p>&lsquo;Sub Julio&rsquo; was I born, though it was late,</p>
		<p class="slindent">And lived at Rome under the good Augustus,</p>
		<p class="slindent">During the time of false and lying gods.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="stanza">
		<p>A poet was I, and I sang that just</p>
		<p class="slindent">Son of Anchises, who came forth from Troy,</p>
		<p class="slindent">After that Ilion the superb was burned.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="stanza">
		<p>But thou, why goest thou back to such annoyance?</p>

	</div>
	<div class="stanza">
		<p>&ldquo;Now, art thou that Virgilius and that fountain</p>
		<p class="slindent">Which spreads abroad so wide a river of speech?&rdquo;</p>
		<p class="slindent">I made response to him with bashful forehead.</p>

	<div class="stanza">
		<p>&ldquo;O, of the other poets honour and light,</p>

		<p>Thou art my master, and my author thou,</p>

		<p>Behold the beast, for which I have turned back;</p>

	</div>
	<div class="stanza">
		<p>&ldquo;Thee it behoves to take another road,&rdquo;</p>

	<div class="stanza">
		<p>Because this beast, at which thou criest out,</p>

	</div>
	<div class="stanza">
		<p>And has a nature so malign and ruthless,</p>

	<div class="stanza">
		<p>Many the animals with whom she weds,</p>
