<div class="stanza"><p>O'er better waves to speed her rapid course</p>
<p>The light bark of my genius lifts the sail,</p>
<p>Well pleas'd to leave so cruel sea behind;</p>
<p>And of that second region will I sing,</p>
<p>In which the human spirit from sinful blot</p>
<p>Is purg'd, and for ascent to Heaven prepares.</p>
<p class="slindent">Here, O ye hallow'd Nine! for in your train</p>
<p>I follow, here the deadened strain revive;</p>
<p>Nor let Calliope refuse to sound</p>
<p>A somewhat higher song, of that loud tone,</p>
<p>Which when the wretched birds of chattering note</p>
<p>Had heard, they of forgiveness lost all hope.</p>
<p class="slindent">Sweet hue of eastern sapphire, that was spread</p>
<p>O'er the serene aspect of the pure air,</p>
<p>High up as the first circle, to mine eyes</p>
<p>Unwonted joy renew'd, soon as I 'scap'd</p>
<p>Forth from the atmosphere of deadly gloom,</p>
<p>That had mine eyes and bosom fill'd with grief.</p>
<p>The radiant planet, that to love invites,</p>
<p>Made all the orient laugh, and veil'd beneath</p>
<p>The Pisces' light, that in his escort came.</p>
<p class="slindent">To the right hand I turn'd, and fix'd my mind</p>
<p>On the' other pole attentive, where I saw</p>
<p>Four stars ne'er seen before save by the ken</p>
<p>Of our first parents. Heaven of their rays</p>
<p>Seem'd joyous. O thou northern site, bereft</p>
<p>Indeed, and widow'd, since of these depriv'd!</p>
<p class="slindent">As from this view I had desisted, straight</p>
<p>Turning a little tow'rds the other pole,</p>
<p>There from whence now the wain had disappear'd,</p>
<p>I saw an old man standing by my side</p>
<p>Alone, so worthy of rev'rence in his look,</p>
<p>That ne'er from son to father more was ow'd.</p>
<p>Low down his beard and mix'd with hoary white</p>
<p>Descended, like his locks, which parting fell</p>
<p>Upon his breast in double fold. The beams</p>
<p>Of those four luminaries on his face</p>
<p>So brightly shone, and with such radiance clear</p>
<p>Deck'd it, that I beheld him as the sun.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Say who are ye, that stemming the blind stream,</p>
<p>Forth from th' eternal prison-house have fled?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke and moved those venerable plumes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who hath conducted, or with lantern sure</p>
<p>Lights you emerging from the depth of night,</p>
<p>That makes the infernal valley ever black?</p>
<p>Are the firm statutes of the dread abyss</p>
<p>Broken, or in high heaven new laws ordain'd,</p>
<p>That thus, condemn'd, ye to my caves approach?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">My guide, then laying hold on me, by words</p>
<p>And intimations given with hand and head,</p>
<p>Made my bent knees and eye submissive pay</p>
<p>Due reverence; then thus to him replied.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Not of myself I come; a Dame from heaven</p>
<p>Descending, had besought me in my charge</p>
<p>To bring. But since thy will implies, that more</p>
<p>Our true condition I unfold at large,</p>
<p>Mine is not to deny thee thy request.</p>
<p>This mortal ne'er hath seen the farthest gloom.</p>
<p>But erring by his folly had approach'd</p>
<p>So near, that little space was left to turn.</p>
<p>Then, as before I told, I was dispatch'd</p>
<p>To work his rescue, and no way remain'd</p>
<p>Save this which I have ta'en. I have display'd</p>
<p>Before him all the regions of the bad;</p>
<p>And purpose now those spirits to display,</p>
<p>That under thy command are purg'd from sin.</p>
<p>How I have brought him would be long to say.</p>
<p>From high descends the virtue, by whose aid</p>
<p>I to thy sight and hearing him have led.</p>
<p>Now may our coming please thee. In the search</p>
<p>Of liberty he journeys: that how dear</p>
<p>They know, who for her sake have life refus'd.</p>
<p>Thou knowest, to whom death for her was sweet</p>
<p>In Utica, where thou didst leave those weeds,</p>
<p>That in the last great day will shine so bright.</p>
<p>For us the' eternal edicts are unmov'd:</p>
<p>He breathes, and I am free of Minos' power,</p>
<p>Abiding in that circle where the eyes</p>
<p>Of thy chaste Marcia beam, who still in look</p>
<p>Prays thee, O hallow'd spirit! to own her shine.</p>
<p>Then by her love we' implore thee, let us pass</p>
<p>Through thy sev'n regions; for which best thanks</p>
<p>I for thy favour will to her return,</p>
<p>If mention there below thou not disdain.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Marcia so pleasing in my sight was found,&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then to him rejoin'd, "while I was there,</p>
<p>That all she ask'd me I was fain to grant.</p>
<p>Now that beyond the' accursed stream she dwells,</p>
<p>She may no longer move me, by that law,</p>
<p>Which was ordain'd me, when I issued thence.</p>
<p>Not so, if Dame from heaven, as thou sayst,</p>
<p>Moves and directs thee; then no flattery needs.</p>
<p>Enough for me that in her name thou ask.</p>
<p>Go therefore now: and with a slender reed</p>
<p>See that thou duly gird him, and his face</p>
<p>Lave, till all sordid stain thou wipe from thence.</p>
<p>For not with eye, by any cloud obscur'd,</p>
<p>Would it be seemly before him to come,</p>
<p>Who stands the foremost minister in heaven.</p>
<p>This islet all around, there far beneath,</p>
<p>Where the wave beats it, on the oozy bed</p>
<p>Produces store of reeds. No other plant,</p>
<p>Cover'd with leaves, or harden'd in its stalk,</p>
<p>There lives, not bending to the water's sway.</p>
<p>After, this way return not; but the sun</p>
<p>Will show you, that now rises, where to take</p>
<p>The mountain in its easiest ascent.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">He disappear'd; and I myself uprais'd</p>
<p>Speechless, and to my guide retiring close,</p>
<p>Toward him turn'd mine eyes. He thus began;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son! observant thou my steps pursue.</p>
<p>We must retreat to rearward, for that way</p>
<p>The champain to its low extreme declines.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">The dawn had chas'd the matin hour of prime,</p>
<p>Which deaf before it, so that from afar</p>
<p>I spy'd the trembling of the ocean stream.</p>
<p class="slindent">We travers'd the deserted plain, as one</p>
<p>Who, wander'd from his track, thinks every step</p>
<p>Trodden in vain till he regain the path.</p>
<p class="slindent">When we had come, where yet the tender dew</p>
<p>Strove with the sun, and in a place, where fresh</p>
<p>The wind breath'd o'er it, while it slowly dried;</p>
<p>Both hands extended on the watery grass</p>
<p>My master plac'd, in graceful act and kind.</p>
<p>Whence I of his intent before appriz'd,</p>
<p>Stretch'd out to him my cheeks suffus'd with tears.</p>
<p>There to my visage he anew restor'd</p>
<p>That hue, which the dun shades of hell conceal'd.</p>
<p class="slindent">Then on the solitary shore arriv'd,</p>
<p>That never sailing on its waters saw</p>
<p>Man, that could after measure back his course,</p>
<p>He girt me in such manner as had pleas'd</p>
<p>Him who instructed, and O, strange to tell!</p>
<p>As he selected every humble plant,</p>
<p>Wherever one was pluck'd, another there</p>
<p>Resembling, straightway in its place arose.</p>
</div>`,

`<p class="cantohead">CANTO II</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>Now had the sun to that horizon reach'd,</p>
<p>That covers, with the most exalted point</p>
<p>Of its meridian circle, Salem's walls,</p>
<p>And night, that opposite to him her orb</p>
<p>Sounds, from the stream of Ganges issued forth,</p>
<p>Holding the scales, that from her hands are dropp'd</p>
<p>When she reigns highest: so that where I was,</p>
<p>Aurora's white and vermeil-tinctur'd cheek</p>
<p>To orange turn'd as she in age increas'd.</p>
<p class="slindent">Meanwhile we linger'd by the water's brink,</p>
<p>Like men, who, musing on their road, in thought</p>
<p>Journey, while motionless the body rests.</p>
<p>When lo! as near upon the hour of dawn,</p>
<p>Through the thick vapours Mars with fiery beam</p>
<p>Glares down in west, over the ocean floor;</p>
<p>So seem'd, what once again I hope to view,</p>
<p>A light so swiftly coming through the sea,</p>
<p>No winged course might equal its career.</p>
<p>From which when for a space I had withdrawn</p>
<p>Thine eyes, to make inquiry of my guide,</p>
<p>Again I look'd and saw it grown in size</p>
<p>And brightness: thou on either side appear'd</p>
<p>Something, but what I knew not of bright hue,</p>
<p>And by degrees from underneath it came</p>
<p>Another. My preceptor silent yet</p>
<p>Stood, while the brightness, that we first discern'd,</p>
<p>Open'd the form of wings: then when he knew</p>
<p>The pilot, cried aloud, "Down, down; bend low</p>
<p>Thy knees; behold God's angel: fold thy hands:</p>
<p>Now shalt thou see true Ministers indeed.</p>
<p>Lo how all human means he sets at naught!</p>
<p>So that nor oar he needs, nor other sail</p>
<p>Except his wings, between such distant shores.</p>
<p>Lo how straight up to heaven he holds them rear'd,</p>
<p>Winnowing the air with those eternal plumes,</p>
<p>That not like mortal hairs fall off or change!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">As more and more toward us came, more bright</p>
<p>Appear'd the bird of God, nor could the eye</p>
<p>Endure his splendor near: I mine bent down.</p>
<p>He drove ashore in a small bark so swift</p>
<p>And light, that in its course no wave it drank.</p>
<p>The heav'nly steersman at the prow was seen,</p>
<p>Visibly written blessed in his looks.</p>
<p>Within a hundred spirits and more there sat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Exitu Israel de Aegypto;&rdquo;</p>
<p>All with one voice together sang, with what</p>
<p>In the remainder of that hymn is writ.</p>
<p>Then soon as with the sign of holy cross</p>
<p>He bless'd them, they at once leap'd out on land,</p>
<p>The swiftly as he came return'd. The crew,</p>
<p>There left, appear'd astounded with the place,</p>
<p>Gazing around as one who sees new sights.</p>
<p class="slindent">From every side the sun darted his beams,</p>
<p>And with his arrowy radiance from mid heav'n</p>
<p>Had chas'd the Capricorn, when that strange tribe</p>
<p>Lifting their eyes towards us: If ye know,</p>
<p>Declare what path will Lead us to the mount.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Them Virgil answer'd. "Ye suppose perchance</p>
<p>Us well acquainted with this place: but here,</p>
<p>We, as yourselves, are strangers. Not long erst</p>
<p>We came, before you but a little space,</p>
<p>By other road so rough and hard, that now</p>
<p>The' ascent will seem to us as play.&rdquo; The spirits,</p>
<p>Who from my breathing had perceiv'd I liv'd,</p>
<p>Grew pale with wonder. As the multitude</p>
<p>Flock round a herald, sent with olive branch,</p>
<p>To hear what news he brings, and in their haste</p>
<p>Tread one another down, e'en so at sight</p>
<p>Of me those happy spirits were fix'd, each one</p>
<p>Forgetful of its errand, to depart,</p>
<p>Where cleans'd from sin, it might be made all fair.</p>
<p class="slindent">Then one I saw darting before the rest</p>
<p>With such fond ardour to embrace me, I</p>
<p>To do the like was mov'd. O shadows vain</p>
<p>Except in outward semblance! thrice my hands</p>
<p>I clasp'd behind it, they as oft return'd</p>
<p>Empty into my breast again. Surprise</p>
<p>I needs must think was painted in my looks,</p>
<p>For that the shadow smil'd and backward drew.</p>
<p>To follow it I hasten'd, but with voice</p>
<p>Of sweetness it enjoin'd me to desist.</p>
<p>Then who it was I knew, and pray'd of it,</p>
<p>To talk with me, it would a little pause.</p>
<p>It answered: "Thee as in my mortal frame</p>
<p>I lov'd, so loos'd forth it I love thee still,</p>
<p>And therefore pause; but why walkest thou here?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Not without purpose once more to return,</p>
<p>Thou find'st me, my Casella, where I am</p>
<p>Journeying this way;&rdquo; I said, "but how of thee</p>
<p>Hath so much time been lost?&rdquo; He answer'd straight:</p>
<p>&ldquo;No outrage hath been done to me, if he</p>
<p>Who when and whom he chooses takes, me oft</p>
<p>This passage hath denied, since of just will</p>
<p>His will he makes. These three months past indeed,</p>
<p>He, whose chose to enter, with free leave</p>
<p>Hath taken; whence I wand'ring by the shore</p>
<p>Where Tyber's wave grows salt, of him gain'd kind</p>
<p>Admittance, at that river's mouth, tow'rd which</p>
<p>His wings are pointed, for there always throng</p>
<p>All such as not to Archeron descend.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Then I: "If new laws have not quite destroy'd</p>
<p>Memory and use of that sweet song of love,</p>
<p>That while all my cares had power to 'swage;</p>
<p>Please thee with it a little to console</p>
<p>My spirit, that incumber'd with its frame,</p>
<p>Travelling so far, of pain is overcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Love that discourses in my thoughts.&rdquo; He then</p>
<p>Began in such soft accents, that within</p>
<p>The sweetness thrills me yet. My gentle guide</p>
<p>And all who came with him, so well were pleas'd,</p>
<p>That seem'd naught else might in their thoughts have room.</p>
<p class="slindent">Fast fix'd in mute attention to his notes</p>
<p>We stood, when lo! that old man venerable</p>
<p>Exclaiming, "How is this, ye tardy spirits?</p>
<p>What negligence detains you loit'ring here?</p>
<p>Run to the mountain to cast off those scales,</p>
<p>That from your eyes the sight of God conceal.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">As a wild flock of pigeons, to their food</p>
<p>Collected, blade or tares, without their pride</p>
<p>Accustom'd, and in still and quiet sort,</p>
<p>If aught alarm them, suddenly desert</p>
<p>Their meal, assail'd by more important care;</p>
<p>So I that new-come troop beheld, the song</p>
<p>Deserting, hasten to the mountain's side,</p>
<p>As one who goes yet where he tends knows not.</p>
<p class="slindent">Nor with less hurried step did we depart.</p>
</div>`,

`<p class="cantohead">CANTO III</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>Them sudden flight had scatter'd over the plain,</p>
<p>Turn'd tow'rds the mountain, whither reason's voice</p>
<p>Drives us; I to my faithful company</p>
<p>Adhering, left it not. For how of him</p>
<p>Depriv'd, might I have sped, or who beside</p>
<p>Would o'er the mountainous tract have led my steps</p>
<p>He with the bitter pang of self-remorse</p>
<p>Seem'd smitten. O clear conscience and upright</p>
<p>How doth a little fling wound thee sore!</p>
<p class="slindent">Soon as his feet desisted (slack'ning pace),</p>
<p>From haste, that mars all decency of act,</p>
<p>My mind, that in itself before was wrapt,</p>
<p>Its thoughts expanded, as with joy restor'd:</p>
<p>And full against the steep ascent I set</p>
<p>My face, where highest to heav'n its top o'erflows.</p>
<p class="slindent">The sun, that flar'd behind, with ruddy beam</p>
<p>Before my form was broken; for in me</p>
<p>His rays resistance met. I turn'd aside</p>
<p>With fear of being left, when I beheld</p>
<p>Only before myself the ground obscur'd.</p>
<p>When thus my solace, turning him around,</p>
<p>Bespake me kindly: "Why distrustest thou?</p>
<p>Believ'st not I am with thee, thy sure guide?</p>
<p>It now is evening there, where buried lies</p>
<p>The body, in which I cast a shade, remov'd</p>
<p>To Naples from Brundusium's wall. Nor thou</p>
<p>Marvel, if before me no shadow fall,</p>
<p>More than that in the sky element</p>
<p>One ray obstructs not other. To endure</p>
<p>Torments of heat and cold extreme, like frames</p>
<p>That virtue hath dispos'd, which how it works</p>
<p>Wills not to us should be reveal'd. Insane</p>
<p>Who hopes, our reason may that space explore,</p>
<p>Which holds three persons in one substance knit.</p>
<p>Seek not the wherefore, race of human kind;</p>
<p>Could ye have seen the whole, no need had been</p>
<p>For Mary to bring forth. Moreover ye</p>
<p>Have seen such men desiring fruitlessly;</p>
<p>To whose desires repose would have been giv'n,</p>
<p>That now but serve them for eternal grief.</p>
<p>I speak of Plato, and the Stagyrite,</p>
<p>And others many more.&rdquo; And then he bent</p>
<p>Downwards his forehead, and in troubled mood</p>
<p>Broke off his speech. Meanwhile we had arriv'd</p>
<p>Far as the mountain's foot, and there the rock</p>
<p>Found of so steep ascent, that nimblest steps</p>
<p>To climb it had been vain. The most remote</p>
<p>Most wild untrodden path, in all the tract</p>
<p>'Twixt Lerice and Turbia were to this</p>
<p>A ladder easy' and open of access.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Who knows on which hand now the steep declines?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My master said and paus'd, "so that he may</p>
<p>Ascend, who journeys without aid of wine,?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And while with looks directed to the ground</p>
<p>The meaning of the pathway he explor'd,</p>
<p>And I gaz'd upward round the stony height,</p>
<p>Of spirits, that toward us mov'd their steps,</p>
<p>Yet moving seem'd not, they so slow approach'd.</p>
<p class="slindent">I thus my guide address'd: "Upraise thine eyes,</p>
<p>Lo that way some, of whom thou may'st obtain</p>
<p>Counsel, if of thyself thou find'st it not!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Straightway he look'd, and with free speech replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us tend thither: they but softly come.</p>
<p>And thou be firm in hope, my son belov'd.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Now was that people distant far in space</p>
<p>A thousand paces behind ours, as much</p>
<p>As at a throw the nervous arm could fling,</p>
<p>When all drew backward on the messy crags</p>
<p>Of the steep bank, and firmly stood unmov'd</p>
<p>As one who walks in doubt might stand to look.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;O spirits perfect! O already chosen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Virgil to them began, "by that blest peace,</p>
<p>Which, as I deem, is for you all prepar'd,</p>
<p>Instruct us where the mountain low declines,</p>
<p>So that attempt to mount it be not vain.</p>
<p>For who knows most, him loss of time most grieves.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">As sheep, that step from forth their fold, by one,</p>
<p>Or pairs, or three at once; meanwhile the rest</p>
<p>Stand fearfully, bending the eye and nose</p>
<p>To ground, and what the foremost does, that do</p>
<p>The others, gath'ring round her, if she stops,</p>
<p>Simple and quiet, nor the cause discern;</p>
<p>So saw I moving to advance the first,</p>
<p>Who of that fortunate crew were at the head,</p>
<p>Of modest mien and graceful in their gait.</p>
<p>When they before me had beheld the light</p>
<p>From my right side fall broken on the ground,</p>
<p>So that the shadow reach'd the cave, they stopp'd</p>
<p>And somewhat back retir'd: the same did all,</p>
<p>Who follow'd, though unweeting of the cause</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Unask'd of you, yet freely I confess,</p>
<p>This is a human body which ye see.</p>
<p>That the sun's light is broken on the ground,</p>
<p>Marvel not: but believe, that not without</p>
<p>Virtue deriv'd from Heaven, we to climb</p>
<p>Over this wall aspire.&rdquo; So them bespake</p>
<p>My master; and that virtuous tribe rejoin'd;</p>
<p>&ldquo; Turn, and before you there the entrance lies,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Making a signal to us with bent hands.</p>
<p class="slindent">Then of them one began. "Whoe'er thou art,</p>
<p>Who journey'st thus this way, thy visage turn,</p>
<p>Think if me elsewhere thou hast ever seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">I tow'rds him turn'd, and with fix'd eye beheld.</p>
<p>Comely, and fair, and gentle of aspect,</p>
<p>He seem'd, but on one brow a gash was mark'd.</p>
<p class="slindent">When humbly I disclaim'd to have beheld</p>
<p>Him ever: "Now behold!&rdquo; he said, and show'd</p>
<p>High on his breast a wound: then smiling spake.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;I am Manfredi, grandson to the Queen</p>
<p>Costanza: whence I pray thee, when return'd,</p>
<p>To my fair daughter go, the parent glad</p>
<p>Of Aragonia and Sicilia's pride;</p>
<p>And of the truth inform her, if of me</p>
<p>Aught else be told. When by two mortal blows</p>
<p>My frame was shatter'd, I betook myself</p>
<p>Weeping to him, who of free will forgives.</p>
<p>My sins were horrible; but so wide arms</p>
<p>Hath goodness infinite, that it receives</p>
<p>All who turn to it. Had this text divine</p>
<p>Been of Cosenza's shepherd better scann'd,</p>
<p>Who then by Clement on my hunt was set,</p>
<p>Yet at the bridge's head my bones had lain,</p>
<p>Near Benevento, by the heavy mole</p>
<p>Protected; but the rain now drenches them,</p>
<p>And the wind drives, out of the kingdom's bounds,</p>
<p>Far as the stream of Verde, where, with lights</p>
<p>Extinguish'd, he remov'd them from their bed.</p>
<p>Yet by their curse we are not so destroy'd,</p>
<p>But that the eternal love may turn, while hope</p>
<p>Retains her verdant blossoms. True it is,</p>
<p>That such one as in contumacy dies</p>
<p>Against the holy church, though he repent,</p>
<p>Must wander thirty-fold for all the time</p>
<p>In his presumption past; if such decree</p>
<p>Be not by prayers of good men shorter made</p>
<p>Look therefore if thou canst advance my bliss;</p>
<p>Revealing to my good Costanza, how</p>
<p>Thou hast beheld me, and beside the terms</p>
<p>Laid on me of that interdict; for here</p>
<p>By means of those below much profit comes.&rdquo;</p>
</div>`,

`<p class="cantohead">CANTO IV</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>When by sensations of delight or pain,</p>
<p>That any of our faculties hath seiz'd,</p>
<p>Entire the soul collects herself, it seems</p>
<p>She is intent upon that power alone,</p>
<p>And thus the error is disprov'd which holds</p>
<p>The soul not singly lighted in the breast.</p>
<p>And therefore when as aught is heard or seen,</p>
<p>That firmly keeps the soul toward it turn'd,</p>
<p>Time passes, and a man perceives it not.</p>
<p>For that, whereby he hearken, is one power,</p>
<p>Another that, which the whole spirit hash;</p>
<p>This is as it were bound, while that is free.</p>
<p class="slindent">This found I true by proof, hearing that spirit</p>
<p>And wond'ring; for full fifty steps aloft</p>
<p>The sun had measur'd unobserv'd of me,</p>
<p>When we arriv'd where all with one accord</p>
<p>The spirits shouted, "Here is what ye ask.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">A larger aperture ofttimes is stopp'd</p>

<p>Ascended solitary, when that troop</p>
<p>Departing left us. On Sanleo's road</p>
<p>Who journeys, or to Noli low descends,</p>
<p>Or mounts Bismantua's height, must use his feet;</p>
<p>But here a man had need to fly, I mean</p>
<p>With the swift wing and plumes of high desire,</p>
<p>Conducted by his aid, who gave me hope,</p>
<p>And with light furnish'd to direct my way.</p>
<p class="slindent">We through the broken rock ascended, close</p>
<p>Pent on each side, while underneath the ground</p>
<p>Ask'd help of hands and feet. When we arriv'd</p>
<p>Near on the highest ridge of the steep bank,</p>
<p>Where the plain level open'd I exclaim'd,</p>
<p>&ldquo;O master! say which way can we proceed?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">He answer'd, "Let no step of thine recede.</p>
<p>Behind me gain the mountain, till to us</p>
<p>Some practis'd guide appear.&rdquo; That eminence</p>
<p>Was lofty that no eye might reach its point,</p>
<p>And the side proudly rising, more than line</p>
<p>From the mid quadrant to the centre drawn.</p>
<p>I wearied thus began: "Parent belov'd!</p>
<p>Turn, and behold how I remain alonw,</p>
<p>If thou stay not.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;My son!&rdquo; He straight reply'd,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thus far put forth thy strength; "and to a track</p>
<p>Pointed, that, on this side projecting, round</p>
<p>Circles the hill. His words so spurr'd me on,</p>
<p>That I behind him clamb'ring, forc'd myself,</p>
<p>Till my feet press'd the circuit plain beneath.</p>
<p>There both together seated, turn'd we round</p>
<p>To eastward, whence was our ascent: and oft</p>
<p>Many beside have with delight look'd back.</p>
<p class="slindent">First on the nether shores I turn'd my eyes,</p>
<p>Then rais'd them to the sun, and wond'ring mark'd</p>
<p>That from the left it smote us. Soon perceiv'd</p>
<p>That Poet sage how at the car of light</p>
<p>Amaz'd I stood, where 'twixt us and the north</p>
<p>Its course it enter'd. Whence he thus to me:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were Leda's offspring now in company</p>
<p>Of that broad mirror, that high up and low</p>
<p>Imparts his light beneath, thou might'st behold</p>
<p>The ruddy zodiac nearer to the bears</p>
<p>Wheel, if its ancient course it not forsook.</p>
<p>How that may be if thou would'st think; within</p>
<p>Pond'ring, imagine Sion with this mount</p>
<p>Plac'd on the earth, so that to both be one</p>
<p>Horizon, and two hemispheres apart,</p>
<p>Where lies the path that Phaeton ill knew</p>
<p>To guide his erring chariot: thou wilt see</p>
<p>How of necessity by this on one</p>
<p>He passes, while by that on the' other side,</p>
<p>If with clear view shine intellect attend.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Of truth, kind teacher!&rdquo; I exclaim'd, "so clear</p>
<p>Aught saw I never, as I now discern</p>
<p>Where seem'd my ken to fail, that the mid orb</p>
<p>Of the supernal motion (which in terms</p>
<p>Of art is called the Equator, and remains</p>
<p>Ever between the sun and winter) for the cause</p>
<p>Thou hast assign'd, from hence toward the north</p>
<p>Departs, when those who in the Hebrew land</p>
<p>Inhabit, see it tow'rds the warmer part.</p>
<p>But if it please thee, I would gladly know,</p>
<p>How far we have to journey: for the hill</p>
<p>Mounts higher, than this sight of mine can mount.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">He thus to me: "Such is this steep ascent,</p>
<p>That it is ever difficult at first,</p>
<p>But, more a man proceeds, less evil grows.</p>
<p>When pleasant it shall seem to thee, so much</p>
<p>That upward going shall be easy to thee.</p>
<p>As in a vessel to go down the tide,</p>
<p>Then of this path thou wilt have reach'd the end.</p>
<p>There hope to rest thee from thy toil. No more</p>
<p>I answer, and thus far for certain know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he his words had spoken, near to us</p>
<p>A voice there sounded: "Yet ye first perchance</p>
<p>May to repose you by constraint be led.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At sound thereof each turn'd, and on the left</p>
<p>A huge stone we beheld, of which nor I</p>
<p>Nor he before was ware. Thither we drew,</p>
<p>find there were some, who in the shady place</p>
<p>Behind the rock were standing, as a man</p>
<p>Thru' idleness might stand. Among them one,</p>
<p>Who seem'd to me much wearied, sat him down,</p>
<p>And with his arms did fold his knees about,</p>
<p>Holding his face between them downward bent.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Sweet Sir!&rdquo; I cry'd, "behold that man, who shows</p>
<p>Himself more idle, than if laziness</p>
<p>Were sister to him.&rdquo; Straight he turn'd to us,</p>
<p>And, o'er the thigh lifting his face, observ'd,</p>
<p>Then in these accents spake: "Up then, proceed</p>
<p>Thou valiant one.&rdquo; Straight who it was I knew;</p>
<p>Nor could the pain I felt (for want of breath</p>
<p>Still somewhat urg'd me) hinder my approach.</p>
<p>And when I came to him, he scarce his head</p>
<p>Uplifted, saying "Well hast thou discern'd,</p>
<p>How from the left the sun his chariot leads.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">His lazy acts and broken words my lips</p>
<p>To laughter somewhat mov'd; when I began:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Belacqua, now for thee I grieve no more.</p>
<p>But tell, why thou art seated upright there?</p>
<p>Waitest thou escort to conduct thee hence?</p>
<p>Or blame I only shine accustom'd ways?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he: "My brother, of what use to mount,</p>
<p>When to my suffering would not let me pass</p>
<p>The bird of God, who at the portal sits?</p>
<p>Behooves so long that heav'n first bear me round</p>
<p>Without its limits, as in life it bore,</p>
<p>Because I to the end repentant Sighs</p>
<p>Delay'd, if prayer do not aid me first,</p>
<p>That riseth up from heart which lives in grace.</p>
<p>What other kind avails, not heard in heaven?"'</p>
<p class="slindent">Before me now the Poet up the mount</p>
<p>Ascending, cried: "Haste thee, for see the sun</p>
<p>Has touch'd the point meridian, and the night</p>
<p>Now covers with her foot Marocco's shore.&rdquo;</p>

`<p class="cantohead">CANTO V</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>Now had I left those spirits, and pursued</p>
<p>The steps of my Conductor, when beheld</p>
<p>Pointing the finger at me one exclaim'd:</p>
<p>&ldquo;See how it seems as if the light not shone</p>
<p>From the left hand of him beneath, and he,</p>
<p>As living, seems to be led on.&rdquo; Mine eyes</p>
<p>I at that sound reverting, saw them gaze</p>
<p>Through wonder first at me, and then at me</p>
<p>And the light broken underneath, by turns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are thy thoughts thus riveted?&rdquo; my guide</p>
<p>Exclaim'd, "that thou hast slack'd thy pace? or how</p>
<p>Imports it thee, what thing is whisper'd here?</p>
<p>Come after me, and to their babblings leave</p>
<p>The crowd. Be as a tower, that, firmly set,</p>
<p>Shakes not its top for any blast that blows!</p>
<p>He, in whose bosom thought on thought shoots out,</p>
<p>Still of his aim is wide, in that the one</p>
<p>Sicklies and wastes to nought the other's strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">What other could I answer save "I come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said it, somewhat with that colour ting'd</p>
<p>Which ofttimes pardon meriteth for man.</p>
<p class="slindent">Meanwhile traverse along the hill there came,</p>
<p>A little way before us, some who sang</p>
<p>The "Miserere&rdquo; in responsive Strains.</p>
<p>When they perceiv'd that through my body I</p>
<p>Gave way not for the rays to pass, their song</p>
<p>Straight to a long and hoarse exclaim they chang'd;</p>
<p>And two of them, in guise of messengers,</p>
<p>Ran on to meet us, and inquiring ask'd:</p>
<p>Of your condition we would gladly learn.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">To them my guide. "Ye may return, and bear</p>
<p>Tidings to them who sent you, that his frame</p>
<p>Is real flesh. If, as I deem, to view</p>
<p>His shade they paus'd, enough is answer'd them.</p>
<p>Him let them honour, they may prize him well.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Ne'er saw I fiery vapours with such speed</p>
<p>Cut through the serene air at fall of night,</p>
<p>Nor August's clouds athwart the setting sun,</p>
<p>That upward these did not in shorter space</p>
<p>Return; and, there arriving, with the rest</p>
<p>Wheel back on us, as with loose rein a troop.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Many,&rdquo; exclaim'd the bard, "are these, who throng</p>
<p>Around us: to petition thee they come.</p>
<p>Go therefore on, and listen as thou go'st.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;O spirit! who go'st on to blessedness</p>
<p>With the same limbs, that clad thee at thy birth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Shouting they came, "a little rest thy step.</p>
<p>Look if thou any one amongst our tribe</p>
<p>Hast e'er beheld, that tidings of him there</p>
<p>Thou mayst report. Ah, wherefore go'st thou on?</p>
<p>Ah wherefore tarriest thou not? We all</p>
<p>By violence died, and to our latest hour</p>
<p>Were sinners, but then warn'd by light from heav'n,</p>
<p>So that, repenting and forgiving, we</p>
<p>Did issue out of life at peace with God,</p>
<p>Who with desire to see him fills our heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Then I: "The visages of all I scan</p>
<p>Yet none of ye remember. But if aught,</p>
<p>That I can do, may please you, gentle spirits!</p>
<p>Speak; and I will perform it, by that peace,</p>
<p>Which on the steps of guide so excellent</p>
<p>Following from world to world intent I seek.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">In answer he began: "None here distrusts</p>
<p>Thy kindness, though not promis'd with an oath;</p>
<p>So as the will fail not for want of power.</p>
<p>Whence I, who sole before the others speak,</p>
<p>Entreat thee, if thou ever see that land,</p>
<p>Which lies between Romagna and the realm</p>
<p>Of Charles, that of thy courtesy thou pray</p>
<p>Those who inhabit Fano, that for me</p>
<p>Their adorations duly be put up,</p>
<p>By which I may purge off my grievous sins.</p>
<p>From thence I came. But the deep passages,</p>
<p>Whence issued out the blood wherein I dwelt,</p>
<p>Upon my bosom in Antenor's land</p>
<p>Were made, where to be more secure I thought.</p>
<p>The author of the deed was Este's prince,</p>
<p>Who, more than right could warrant, with his wrath</p>
<p>Pursued me. Had I towards Mira fled,</p>
<p>When overta'en at Oriaco, still</p>
<p>Might I have breath'd. But to the marsh I sped,</p>
<p>And in the mire and rushes tangled there</p>
<p>Fell, and beheld my life-blood float the plain.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Then said another: "Ah! so may the wish,</p>
<p>That takes thee o'er the mountain, be fulfill'd,</p>
<p>As thou shalt graciously give aid to mine.</p>
<p>Of Montefeltro I; Buonconte I:</p>
<p>Giovanna nor none else have care for me,</p>
<p>Sorrowing with these I therefore go.&rdquo; I thus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Campaldino's field what force or chance</p>
<p>Drew thee, that ne'er thy sepulture was known?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; answer'd he, "at Casentino's foot</p>
<p>A stream there courseth, nam'd Archiano, sprung</p>
<p>In Apennine above the Hermit's seat.</p>
<p>E'en where its name is cancel'd, there came I,</p>
<p>Pierc'd in the heart, fleeing away on foot,</p>
<p>And bloodying the plain. Here sight and speech</p>
<p>Fail'd me, and finishing with Mary's name</p>
<p>I fell, and tenantless my flesh remain'd.</p>
<p>I will report the truth; which thou again0</p>
<p>Tell to the living. Me God's angel took,</p>
<p>Whilst he of hell exclaim'd: "O thou from heav'n!</p>
<p>Say wherefore hast thou robb'd me? Thou of him</p>
<p>Th' eternal portion bear'st with thee away</p>
<p>For one poor tear that he deprives me of.</p>
<p>But of the other, other rule I make.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Thou knowest how in the atmosphere collects</p>
<p>That vapour dank, returning into water,</p>
<p>Soon as it mounts where cold condenses it.</p>
<p>That evil will, which in his intellect</p>
<p>Still follows evil, came, and rais'd the wind</p>
<p>And smoky mist, by virtue of the power</p>
<p>Given by his nature. Thence the valley, soon</p>
<p>As day was spent, he cover'd o'er with cloud</p>
<p>From Pratomagno to the mountain range,</p>
<p>And stretch'd the sky above, so that the air</p>
<p>Impregnate chang'd to water. Fell the rain,</p>
<p>And to the fosses came all that the land</p>
<p>Contain'd not; and, as mightiest streams are wont,</p>
<p>To the great river with such headlong sweep</p>
<p>Rush'd, that nought stay'd its course. My stiffen'd frame</p>
<p>Laid at his mouth the fell Archiano found,</p>
<p>And dash'd it into Arno, from my breast</p>
<p>Loos'ning the cross, that of myself I made</p>
<p>When overcome with pain. He hurl'd me on,</p>
<p>Along the banks and bottom of his course;</p>
<p>Then in his muddy spoils encircling wrapt.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Ah! when thou to the world shalt be return'd,</p>
<p>And rested after thy long road,&rdquo; so spake</p>
<p>Next the third spirit; "then remember me.</p>

<p>He, who hath lost, remains in sadness fix'd,</p>
<p>Revolving in his mind, what luckless throws</p>
<p>He cast: but meanwhile all the company</p>
<p>Go with the other; one before him runs,</p>
<p>And one behind his mantle twitches, one</p>
<p>Fast by his side bids him remember him.</p>
<p>He stops not; and each one, to whom his hand</p>
<p>Is stretch'd, well knows he bids him stand aside;</p>
<p>And thus he from the press defends himself.</p>
<p>E'en such was I in that close-crowding throng;</p>
<p>And turning so my face around to all,</p>
<p>And promising, I 'scap'd from it with pains.</p>
<p class="slindent">Here of Arezzo him I saw, who fell</p>

<p>Stretch'd forth, entreated; and of Pisa he,</p>
<p>Who put the good Marzuco to such proof</p>
<p>Of constancy. Count Orso I beheld;</p>
<p>And from its frame a soul dismiss'd for spite</p>
<p>And envy, as it said, but for no crime:</p>
<p>I speak of Peter de la Brosse; and here,</p>
<p>While she yet lives, that Lady of Brabant</p>
<p>Let her beware; lest for so false a deed</p>
<p>She herd with worse than these. When I was freed</p>
<p>From all those spirits, who pray'd for others' prayers</p>
<p>To hasten on their state of blessedness;</p>
<p>Straight I began: "O thou, my luminary!</p>
<p>It seems expressly in thy text denied,</p>
<p>That heaven's supreme decree can never bend</p>
<p>To supplication; yet with this design</p>
<p>Do these entreat. Can then their hope be vain,</p>
<p>Or is thy saying not to me reveal'd?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">He thus to me: "Both what I write is plain,</p>

<p>Of judgment doth not stoop, because love's flame</p>
<p>In a short moment all fulfils, which he</p>
<p>Who sojourns here, in right should satisfy.</p>
<p>Besides, when I this point concluded thus,</p>
<p>By praying no defect could be supplied;</p>
<p>Because the pray'r had none access to God.</p>
<p>Yet in this deep suspicion rest thou not</p>
<p>Contented unless she assure thee so,</p>
<p>Who betwixt truth and mind infuses light.</p>
<p>I know not if thou take me right; I mean</p>
<p>Beatrice. Her thou shalt behold above,</p>
<p>Upon this mountain's crown, fair seat of joy.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Then I: "Sir! let us mend our speed; for now</p>
<p>I tire not as before; and lo! the hill</p>
<p>Stretches its shadow far.&rdquo; He answer'd thus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our progress with this day shall be as much</p>
<p>As we may now dispatch; but otherwise</p>
<p>Than thou supposest is the truth. For there</p>
<p>Thou canst not be, ere thou once more behold</p>
<p>Him back returning, who behind the steep</p>
<p>Is now so hidden, that as erst his beam</p>
<p>Thou dost not break. But lo! a spirit there</p>
<p>Stands solitary, and toward us looks:</p>
<p>It will instruct us in the speediest way.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">We soon approach'd it. O thou Lombard spirit!</p>
<p>How didst thou stand, in high abstracted mood,</p>
<p>Scarce moving with slow dignity thine eyes!</p>
<p>It spoke not aught, but let us onward pass,</p>
<p>Eyeing us as a lion on his watch.</p>
<p>I3ut Virgil with entreaty mild advanc'd,</p>
<p>Requesting it to show the best ascent.</p>
<p>It answer to his question none return'd,</p>
<p>But of our country and our kind of life</p>
<p>Demanded. When my courteous guide began,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mantua,&rdquo; the solitary shadow quick</p>
<p>Rose towards us from the place in which it stood,</p>

<p>What safety Santafiore can supply.</p>
<p>Come and behold thy Rome, who calls on thee,</p>

<p>But understood the rest, and without blame</p>
<p>Follow'd them all. But if thou know'st and canst,</p>
<p>Direct us, how we soonest may arrive,</p>
<p>Where Purgatory its true beginning takes.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">He answer'd thus: "We have no certain place</p>
<p>Assign'd us: upwards I may go or round,</p>
<p>Far as I can, I join thee for thy guide.</p>
<p>But thou beholdest now how day declines:</p>
<p>And upwards to proceed by night, our power</p>
<p>Excels: therefore it may be well to choose</p>
<p>A place of pleasant sojourn. To the right</p>
<p>Some spirits sit apart retir'd. If thou</p>
<p>Consentest, I to these will lead thy steps:</p>
<p>And thou wilt know them, not without delight.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;How chances this?&rdquo; was answer'd; "who so wish'd</p>
<p>To ascend by night, would he be thence debarr'd</p>
<p>By other, or through his own weakness fail?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">The good Sordello then, along the ground</p>
<p>Trailing his finger, spoke: "Only this line</p>
<p>Thou shalt not overpass, soon as the sun</p>
<p>Hath disappear'd; not that aught else impedes</p>
<p>Thy going upwards, save the shades of night.</p>
<p>These with the wont of power perplex the will.</p>
<p>With them thou haply mightst return beneath,</p>
<p>Or to and fro around the mountain's side</p>
<p>Wander, while day is in the horizon shut.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">My master straight, as wond'ring at his speech,</p>
<p>Exclaim'd: "Then lead us quickly, where thou sayst,</p>
<p>That, while we stay, we may enjoy delight.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">A little space we were remov'd from thence,</p>
<p>When I perceiv'd the mountain hollow'd out.</p>
<p>Ev'n as large valleys hollow'd out on earth,</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;That way,&rdquo; the' escorting spirit cried, "we go,</p>
<p>Where in a bosom the high bank recedes:</p>
<p>And thou await renewal of the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Betwixt the steep and plain a crooked path</p>
<p>Led us traverse into the ridge's side,</p>
<p>Where more than half the sloping edge expires.</p>
<p>Refulgent gold, and silver thrice refin'd,</p>
<p>And scarlet grain and ceruse, Indian wood</p>
<p>Of lucid dye serene, fresh emeralds</p>
<p>But newly broken, by the herbs and flowers</p>
<p>Plac'd in that fair recess, in color all</p>
<p>Had been surpass'd, as great surpasses less.</p>
<p>Nor nature only there lavish'd her hues,</p>
<p>But of the sweetness of a thousand smells</p>
<p>A rare and undistinguish'd fragrance made.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Salve Regina,&rdquo; on the grass and flowers</p>
<p>Here chanting I beheld those spirits sit</p>
<p>Who not beyond the valley could be seen.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Before the west'ring sun sink to his bed,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Began the Mantuan, who our steps had turn'd,</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;'Mid those desires not that I lead ye on.</p>
<p>For from this eminence ye shall discern</p>
<p>Better the acts and visages of all,</p>
<p>Than in the nether vale among them mix'd.</p>
<p>He, who sits high above the rest, and seems</p>
<p>To have neglected that he should have done,</p>
<p>And to the others' song moves not his lip,</p>
<p>The Emperor Rodolph call, who might have heal'd</p>
<p>The wounds whereof fair Italy hath died,</p>
<p>So that by others she revives but slowly,</p>
<p>He, who with kindly visage comforts him,</p>
<p>Sway'd in that country, where the water springs,</p>
<p>That Moldaw's river to the Elbe, and Elbe</p>
<p>Rolls to the ocean: Ottocar his name:</p>
<p>Who in his swaddling clothes was of more worth</p>
<p>Than Winceslaus his son, a bearded man,</p>
<p>Pamper'd with rank luxuriousness and ease.</p>
<p>And that one with the nose depress, who close</p>
<p>In counsel seems with him of gentle look,</p>
<p>Flying expir'd, with'ring the lily's flower.</p>
<p>Look there how he doth knock against his breast!</p>
<p>The other ye behold, who for his cheek</p>
<p>Makes of one hand a couch, with frequent sighs.</p>
<p>They are the father and the father-in-law</p>
<p>Of Gallia's bane: his vicious life they know</p>
<p>And foul; thence comes the grief that rends them thus.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;He, so robust of limb, who measure keeps</p>
<p>In song, with him of feature prominent,</p>
<p>With ev'ry virtue bore his girdle brac'd.</p>
<p>And if that stripling who behinds him sits,</p>
<p>King after him had liv'd, his virtue then</p>
<p>From vessel to like vessel had been pour'd;</p>
<p>Which may not of the other heirs be said.</p>
<p>By James and Frederick his realms are held;</p>
<p>Neither the better heritage obtains.</p>
<p>Rarely into the branches of the tree</p>
<p>Doth human worth mount up; and so ordains</p>
<p>He who bestows it, that as his free gift</p>
<p>It may be call'd. To Charles my words apply</p>
<p>No less than to his brother in the song;</p>
<p>Which Pouille and Provence now with grief confess.</p>
<p>So much that plant degenerates from its seed,</p>

`<p class="cantohead">CANTO VIII</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>>Now was the hour that wakens fond desire</p>
<p>In men at sea, and melts their thoughtful heart,</p>
<p>Who in the morn have bid sweet friends farewell,</p>
<p>And pilgrim newly on his road with love</p>
<p>Thrills, if he hear the vesper bell from far,</p>
<p>That seems to mourn for the expiring day:</p>
<p>When I, no longer taking heed to hear</p>
<p>Began, with wonder, from those spirits to mark</p>
<p>One risen from its seat, which with its hand</p>
<p>Audience implor'd. Both palms it join'd and rais'd,</p>
<p>Fixing its steadfast gaze towards the east,</p>
<p>As telling God, "I care for naught beside.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Te Lucis Ante,&rdquo; so devoutly then</p>
<p>Came from its lip, and in so soft a strain,</p>
<p>That all my sense in ravishment was lost.</p>
<p>And the rest after, softly and devout,</p>
<p>Follow'd through all the hymn, with upward gaze</p>
<p>Directed to the bright supernal wheels.</p>
<p class="slindent">Here, reader! for the truth makes thine eyes keen:</p>
<p>For of so subtle texture is this veil,</p>
<p>That thou with ease mayst pass it through unmark'd.</p>
<p class="slindent">I saw that gentle band silently next</p>
<p>Look up, as if in expectation held,</p>
<p>Pale and in lowly guise; and from on high</p>
<p>I saw forth issuing descend beneath</p>
<p>Two angels with two flame-illumin'd swords,</p>
<p>Broken and mutilated at their points.</p>
<p>Green as the tender leaves but newly born,</p>
<p>Their vesture was, the which by wings as green</p>
<p>Beaten, they drew behind them, fann'd in air.</p>
<p>A little over us one took his stand,</p>
<p>The other lighted on the' Opposing hill,</p>
<p>So that the troop were in the midst contain'd.</p>
<p class="slindent">Well I descried the whiteness on their heads;</p>
<p>But in their visages the dazzled eye</p>
<p>Was lost, as faculty that by too much</p>
<p>Is overpower'd. "From Mary's bosom both</p>
<p>Are come,&rdquo; exclaim'd Sordello, "as a guard</p>
<p>Over the vale, ganst him, who hither tends,</p>
<p>The serpent.&rdquo; Whence, not knowing by which path</p>
<p>He came, I turn'd me round, and closely press'd,</p>
<p>All frozen, to my leader's trusted side.</p>
<p class="slindent">Sordello paus'd not: "To the valley now</p>
<p>(For it is time) let us descend; and hold</p>
<p>Converse with those great shadows: haply much</p>
<p>Their sight may please ye.&rdquo; Only three steps down</p>
<p>Methinks I measur'd, ere I was beneath,</p>
<p>And noted one who look'd as with desire</p>
<p>To know me. Time was now that air arrow dim;</p>
<p>Yet not so dim, that 'twixt his eyes and mine</p>
<p>It clear'd not up what was conceal'd before.</p>
<p>Mutually tow'rds each other we advanc'd.</p>
<p>Nino, thou courteous judge! what joy I felt,</p>
<p>When I perceiv'd thou wert not with the bad!</p>
<p class="slindent">No salutation kind on either part</p>
<p>Was left unsaid. He then inquir'd: "How long</p>
<p>Since thou arrived'st at the mountain's foot,</p>
<p>Over the distant waves?&rdquo; &mdash;&ldquo;O!&rdquo; answer'd I,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through the sad seats of woe this morn I came,</p>
<p>And still in my first life, thus journeying on,</p>
<p>The other strive to gain.&rdquo; Soon as they heard</p>
<p>My words, he and Sordello backward drew,</p>
<p>As suddenly amaz'd. To Virgil one,</p>
<p>The other to a spirit turn'd, who near</p>
<p>Was seated, crying: "Conrad! up with speed:</p>
<p>Come, see what of his grace high God hath will'd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then turning round to me: "By that rare mark</p>
<p>Of honour which thou ow'st to him, who hides</p>
<p>So deeply his first cause, it hath no ford,</p>
<p>When thou shalt he beyond the vast of waves.</p>
<p>Tell my Giovanna, that for me she call</p>
<p>There, where reply to innocence is made.</p>
<p>Her mother, I believe, loves me no more;</p>
<p>Since she has chang'd the white and wimpled folds,</p>
<p>Which she is doom'd once more with grief to wish.</p>
<p>By her it easily may be perceiv'd,</p>
<p>How long in women lasts the flame of love,</p>
<p>If sight and touch do not relume it oft.</p>
<p>For her so fair a burial will not make</p>
<p>The viper which calls Milan to the field,</p>
<p>As had been made by shrill Gallura's bird.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">He spoke, and in his visage took the stamp</p>
<p>Of that right seal, which with due temperature</p>
<p>Glows in the bosom. My insatiate eyes</p>
<p>Meanwhile to heav'n had travel'd, even there</p>
<p>Where the bright stars are slowest, as a wheel</p>
<p>Nearest the axle; when my guide inquir'd:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What there aloft, my son, has caught thy gaze?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">I answer'd: "The three torches, with which here</p>
<p>The pole is all on fire. "He then to me:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The four resplendent stars, thou saw'st this morn</p>
<p>Are there beneath, and these ris'n in their stead.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">While yet he spoke. Sordello to himself</p>
<p>Drew him, and cry'd: "Lo there our enemy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with his hand pointed that way to look.</p>
<p class="slindent">Along the side, where barrier none arose</p>
<p>Around the little vale, a serpent lay,</p>
<p>Such haply as gave Eve the bitter food.</p>
<p>Between the grass and flowers, the evil snake</p>
<p>Came on, reverting oft his lifted head;</p>
<p>And, as a beast that smoothes its polish'd coat,</p>
<p>Licking his hack. I saw not, nor can tell,</p>
<p>How those celestial falcons from their seat</p>
<p>Mov'd, but in motion each one well descried,</p>
<p>Hearing the air cut by their verdant plumes.</p>
<p>The serpent fled; and to their stations back</p>
<p>The angels up return'd with equal flight.</p>
<p class="slindent">The Spirit (who to Nino, when he call'd,</p>
<p>Had come), from viewing me with fixed ken,</p>
<p>Through all that conflict, loosen'd not his sight.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;So may the lamp, which leads thee up on high,</p>
<p>Find, in thy destin'd lot, of wax so much,</p>
<p>As may suffice thee to the enamel's height.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It thus began: "If any certain news</p>
<p>Of Valdimagra and the neighbour part</p>
<p>Thou know'st, tell me, who once was mighty there</p>
<p>They call'd me Conrad Malaspina, not</p>
<p>That old one, but from him I sprang. The love</p>
<p>I bore my people is now here refin'd.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;In your dominions,&rdquo; I answer'd, "ne'er was I.</p>
<p>But through all Europe where do those men dwell,</p>
<p>To whom their glory is not manifest?</p>
<p>The fame, that honours your illustrious house,</p>
<p>Proclaims the nobles and proclaims the land;</p>
<p>So that he knows it who was never there.</p>
<p>I swear to you, so may my upward route</p>
<p>Prosper! your honour'd nation not impairs</p>
<p>The value of her coffer and her sword.</p>
<p>Nature and use give her such privilege,</p>
<p>That while the world is twisted from his course</p>
<p>By a bad head, she only walks aright,</p>
<p>And has the evil way in scorn.&rdquo; He then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now pass thee on: sev'n times the tired sun</p>
<p>Revisits not the couch, which with four feet</p>
<p>The forked Aries covers, ere that kind</p>
<p>Opinion shall be nail'd into thy brain</p>
<p>With stronger nails than other's speech can drive,</p>
<p>If the sure course of judgment be not stay'd.&rdquo;</p>
</div>`,

`<p class="cantohead">CANTO IX</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>Now the fair consort of Tithonus old,</p>
<p>Arisen from her mate's beloved arms,</p>
<p>Look'd palely o'er the eastern cliff: her brow,</p>
<p>Lucent with jewels, glitter'd, set in sign</p>
<p>Of that chill animal, who with his train</p>
<p>Smites fearful nations: and where then we were,</p>
<p>Two steps of her ascent the night had past,</p>
<p>And now the third was closing up its wing,</p>
<p>When I, who had so much of Adam with me,</p>
<p>Sank down upon the grass, o'ercome with sleep,</p>
<p>There where all five were seated. In that hour,</p>
<p>When near the dawn the swallow her sad lay,</p>
<p>Rememb'ring haply ancient grief, renews,</p>
<p>And with our minds more wand'rers from the flesh,</p>
<p>And less by thought restrain'd are, as 't were, full</p>
<p>Of holy divination in their dreams,</p>
<p>Then in a vision did I seem to view</p>
<p>A golden-feather'd eagle in the sky,</p>
<p>With open wings, and hov'ring for descent,</p>
<p>And I was in that place, methought, from whence</p>
<p>Young Ganymede, from his associates 'reft,</p>
<p>Was snatch'd aloft to the high consistory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; thought I within me, "here alone</p>
<p>He strikes his quarry, and elsewhere disdains</p>
<p>To pounce upon the prey.&rdquo; Therewith, it seem'd,</p>
<p>A little wheeling in his airy tour</p>
<p>Terrible as the lightning rush'd he down,</p>
<p>And snatch'd me upward even to the fire.</p>
<p>There both, I thought, the eagle and myself</p>
<p>Did burn; and so intense th' imagin'd flames,</p>
<p>That needs my sleep was broken off. As erst</p>
<p>Achilles shook himself, and round him roll'd</p>
<p>His waken'd eyeballs wond'ring where he was,</p>
<p>Whenas his mother had from Chiron fled</p>
<p>To Scyros, with him sleeping in her arms;</p>
<p>E'en thus I shook me, soon as from my face</p>
<p>The slumber parted, turning deadly pale,</p>
<p>Like one ice-struck with dread. Solo at my side</p>
<p>My comfort stood: and the bright sun was now</p>
<p>More than two hours aloft: and to the sea</p>
<p>My looks were turn'd. "Fear not,&rdquo; my master cried,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assur'd we are at happy point. Thy strength</p>
<p>Shrink not, but rise dilated. Thou art come</p>
<p>To Purgatory now. Lo! there the cliff</p>
<p>That circling bounds it! Lo! the entrance there,</p>
<p>Where it doth seem disparted! Ere the dawn</p>
<p>Usher'd the daylight, when thy wearied soul</p>
<p>Slept in thee, o'er the flowery vale beneath</p>
<p>A lady came, and thus bespake me: "I</p>
<p>Am Lucia. Suffer me to take this man,</p>
<p>Who slumbers. Easier so his way shall speed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sordello and the other gentle shapes</p>
<p>Tarrying, she bare thee up: and, as day shone,</p>
<p>This summit reach'd: and I pursued her steps.</p>
<p>Here did she place thee. First her lovely eyes</p>
<p>That open entrance show'd me; then at once</p>
<p>She vanish'd with thy sleep.&rdquo; Like one, whose doubts</p>
<p>Are chas'd by certainty, and terror turn'd</p>
<p>To comfort on discovery of the truth,</p>
<p>Such was the change in me: and as my guide</p>
<p>Beheld me fearless, up along the cliff</p>
<p>He mov'd, and I behind him, towards the height.</p>
<p class="slindent">Reader! thou markest how my theme doth rise,</p>
<p>Nor wonder therefore, if more artfully</p>
<p>I prop the structure! Nearer now we drew,</p>
<p>Arriv'd' whence in that part, where first a breach</p>
<p>As of a wall appear'd, I could descry</p>
<p>A portal, and three steps beneath, that led</p>
<p>For inlet there, of different colour each,</p>
<p>And one who watch'd, but spake not yet a word.</p>
<p>As more and more mine eye did stretch its view,</p>
<p>I mark'd him seated on the highest step,</p>
<p>In visage such, as past my power to bear.</p>
<p>Grasp'd in his hand a naked sword, glanc'd back</p>
<p>The rays so toward me, that I oft in vain</p>
<p>My sight directed. "Speak from whence ye stand:&rdquo;</p>
<p>He cried: "What would ye? Where is your escort?</p>
<p>Take heed your coming upward harm ye not.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;A heavenly dame, not skilless of these things,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Replied the' instructor, "told us, even now,</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pass that way: here the gate is.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;And may she</p>
<p>Befriending prosper your ascent,&rdquo; resum'd</p>
<p>The courteous keeper of the gate: "Come then</p>
<p>Before our steps.&rdquo; We straightway thither came.</p>
<p class="slindent">The lowest stair was marble white so smooth</p>
<p>And polish'd, that therein my mirror'd form</p>
<p>Distinct I saw. The next of hue more dark</p>
<p>Than sablest grain, a rough and singed block,</p>
<p>Crack'd lengthwise and across. The third, that lay</p>
<p>Massy above, seem'd porphyry, that flam'd</p>
<p>Red as the life-blood spouting from a vein.</p>
<p>On this God's angel either foot sustain'd,</p>
<p>Upon the threshold seated, which appear'd</p>
<p>A rock of diamond. Up the trinal steps</p>
<p>My leader cheerily drew me. "Ask,&rdquo; said he,</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;With humble heart, that he unbar the bolt.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Piously at his holy feet devolv'd</p>
<p>I cast me, praying him for pity's sake</p>
<p>That he would open to me: but first fell</p>
<p>Thrice on my bosom prostrate. Seven times0</p>
<p>The letter, that denotes the inward stain,</p>
<p>He on my forehead with the blunted point</p>
<p>Of his drawn sword inscrib'd. And "Look,&rdquo; he cried,</p>
<p>&ldquo;When enter'd, that thou wash these scars away.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Ashes, or earth ta'en dry out of the ground,</p>
<p>Were of one colour with the robe he wore.</p>
<p>From underneath that vestment forth he drew</p>
<p>Two keys of metal twain: the one was gold,</p>
<p>Its fellow silver. With the pallid first,</p>
<p>And next the burnish'd, he so ply'd the gate,</p>
<p>As to content me well. "Whenever one</p>
<p>Faileth of these, that in the keyhole straight</p>
<p>It turn not, to this alley then expect</p>
<p>Access in vain.&rdquo; Such were the words he spake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One is more precious: but the other needs</p>
<p>Skill and sagacity, large share of each,</p>
<p>Ere its good task to disengage the knot</p>
<p>Be worthily perform'd. From Peter these</p>
<p>I hold, of him instructed, that I err</p>
<p>Rather in opening than in keeping fast;</p>
<p>So but the suppliant at my feet implore.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Then of that hallow'd gate he thrust the door,</p>
<p>Exclaiming, "Enter, but this warning hear:</p>
<p>He forth again departs who looks behind.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">As in the hinges of that sacred ward</p>
<p>The swivels turn'd, sonorous metal strong,</p>
<p>Harsh was the grating; nor so surlily</p>
<p>Roar'd the Tarpeian, when by force bereft</p>
<p>Of good Metellus, thenceforth from his loss</p>
<p>To leanness doom'd. Attentively I turn'd,</p>
<p>List'ning the thunder, that first issued forth;</p>
<p>And "We praise thee, O God,&rdquo; methought I heard</p>
<p>In accents blended with sweet melody.</p>
<p>The strains came o'er mine ear, e'en as the sound</p>
<p>Of choral voices, that in solemn chant</p>
<p>With organ mingle, and, now high and clear,</p>
<p>Come swelling, now float indistinct away.</p>

`<p class="cantohead">CANTO X</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>When we had passed the threshold of the gate</p>
<p>(Which the soul's ill affection doth disuse,</p>
<p>Making the crooked seem the straighter path),</p>
<p>I heard its closing sound. Had mine eyes turn'd,</p>
<p>For that offence what plea might have avail'd?</p>
<p class="slindent">We mounted up the riven rock, that wound</p>
<p>On either side alternate, as the wave</p>
<p>Flies and advances. "Here some little art</p>
<p>Behooves us,&rdquo; said my leader, "that our steps</p>
<p>Observe the varying flexure of the path.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Thus we so slowly sped, that with cleft orb</p>
<p>The moon once more o'erhangs her wat'ry couch,</p>
<p>Ere we that strait have threaded. But when free</p>
<p>We came and open, where the mount above</p>
<p>One solid mass retires, I spent, with toil,</p>
<p>And both, uncertain of the way, we stood,</p>
<p>Upon a plain more lonesome, than the roads</p>
<p>That traverse desert wilds. From whence the brink</p>
<p>Borders upon vacuity, to foot</p>
<p>Of the steep bank, that rises still, the space</p>
<p>Had measur'd thrice the stature of a man:</p>
<p>And, distant as mine eye could wing its flight,</p>
<p>To leftward now and now to right dispatch'd,</p>
<p>That cornice equal in extent appear'd.</p>
<p class="slindent">Not yet our feet had on that summit mov'd,</p>
<p>When I discover'd that the bank around,</p>
<p>Whose proud uprising all ascent denied,</p>
<p>Was marble white, and so exactly wrought</p>
<p>With quaintest sculpture, that not there alone</p>
<p>Had Polycletus, but e'en nature's self</p>
<p>Been sham'd. The angel who came down to earth</p>
<p>With tidings of the peace so many years</p>
<p>Wept for in vain, that op'd the heavenly gates</p>
<p>From their long interdict) before us seem'd,</p>
<p>In a sweet act, so sculptur'd to the life,</p>
<p>He look'd no silent image. One had sworn</p>
<p>He had said, "Hail!&rdquo; for she was imag'd there,</p>
<p>By whom the key did open to God's love,</p>
<p>And in her act as sensibly impress</p>
<p>That word, "Behold the handmaid of the Lord,&rdquo;</p>
<p>As figure seal'd on wax. "Fix not thy mind</p>
<p>On one place only,&rdquo; said the guide belov'd,</p>
<p>Who had me near him on that part where lies</p>
<p>The heart of man. My sight forthwith I turn'd</p>
<p>And mark'd, behind the virgin mother's form,</p>
<p>Upon that side, where he, that mov'd me, stood,</p>
<p>Another story graven on the rock.</p>
<p class="slindent">I passed athwart the bard, and drew me near,</p>
<p>That it might stand more aptly for my view.</p>
<p>There in the self-same marble were engrav'd</p>
<p>The cart and kine, drawing the sacred ark,</p>
<p>That from unbidden office awes mankind.</p>
<p>Before it came much people; and the whole</p>
<p>Parted in seven quires. One sense cried, "Nay,&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another, "Yes, they sing.&rdquo; Like doubt arose</p>
<p>Betwixt the eye and smell, from the curl'd fume</p>
<p>Of incense breathing up the well-wrought toil.</p>
<p>Preceding the blest vessel, onward came</p>
<p>With light dance leaping, girt in humble guise,</p>
<p>Sweet Israel's harper: in that hap he seem'd</p>
<p>Less and yet more than kingly. Opposite,</p>
<p>At a great palace, from the lattice forth</p>
<p>Look'd Michol, like a lady full of scorn</p>
<p>And sorrow. To behold the tablet next,</p>
<p>Which at the hack of Michol whitely shone,</p>
<p>I mov'd me. There was storied on the rock</p>
<p>The' exalted glory of the Roman prince,</p>
<p>Whose mighty worth mov'd Gregory to earn</p>
<p>His mighty conquest, Trajan th' Emperor.</p>
<p>A widow at his bridle stood, attir'd</p>
<p>In tears and mourning. Round about them troop'd</p>
<p>Full throng of knights, and overhead in gold</p>
<p>The eagles floated, struggling with the wind.</p>
<p>The wretch appear'd amid all these to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grant vengeance, sire! for, woe beshrew this heart</p>
<p>My son is murder'd.&rdquo; He replying seem'd;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Wait now till I return.&rdquo; And she, as one</p>
<p>Made hasty by her grief; "O sire, if thou</p>
<p>Dost not return?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Where I am, who then is,</p>
<p>May right thee.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo; What to thee is other's good,</p>
<p>If thou neglect thy own?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Now comfort thee,&rdquo;</p>
<p>At length he answers. "It beseemeth well</p>
<p>My duty be perform'd, ere I move hence:</p>
<p>So justice wills; and pity bids me stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">He, whose ken nothing new surveys, produc'd</p>
<p>That visible speaking, new to us and strange</p>
<p>The like not found on earth. Fondly I gaz'd</p>
<p>Upon those patterns of meek humbleness,</p>
<p>Shapes yet more precious for their artist's sake,</p>
<p>When "Lo,&rdquo; the poet whisper'd, "where this way</p>
<p>(But slack their pace), a multitude advance.</p>
<p>These to the lofty steps shall guide us on.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Mine eyes, though bent on view of novel sights</p>
<p>Their lov'd allurement, were not slow to turn.</p>
<p class="slindent">Reader! I would not that amaz'd thou miss</p>
<p>Of thy good purpose, hearing how just God</p>
<p>Decrees our debts be cancel'd. Ponder not</p>
<p>The form of suff'ring. Think on what succeeds,</p>
<p>Think that at worst beyond the mighty doom</p>
<p>It cannot pass. "Instructor,&rdquo; I began,</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I see hither tending, bears no trace</p>
<p>Of human semblance, nor of aught beside</p>
<p>That my foil'd sight can guess.&rdquo; He answering thus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So courb'd to earth, beneath their heavy teems</p>
<p>Of torment stoop they, that mine eye at first</p>
<p>Struggled as thine. But look intently thither,</p>
<p>An disentangle with thy lab'ring view,</p>
<p>What underneath those stones approacheth: now,</p>
<p>E'en now, mayst thou discern the pangs of each.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Christians and proud! O poor and wretched ones!</p>
<p>That feeble in the mind's eye, lean your trust</p>
<p>Upon unstaid perverseness! Know ye not</p>
<p>That we are worms, yet made at last to form</p>
<p>The winged insect, imp'd with angel plumes</p>
<p>That to heaven's justice unobstructed soars?</p>
<p>Why buoy ye up aloft your unfleg'd souls?</p>
<p>Abortive then and shapeless ye remain,</p>
<p>Like the untimely embryon of a worm!</p>
<p class="slindent">As, to support incumbent floor or roof,</p>
<p>For corbel is a figure sometimes seen,</p>
<p>That crumples up its knees unto its breast,</p>
<p>With the feign'd posture stirring ruth unfeign'd</p>
<p>In the beholder's fancy; so I saw</p>
<p>These fashion'd, when I noted well their guise.</p>
<p class="slindent">Each, as his back was laden, came indeed</p>
<p>Or more or less contract; but it appear'd</p>
<p>As he, who show'd most patience in his look,</p>
<p>Wailing exclaim'd: "I can endure no more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>'Gainst the old adversary prove thou not</p>
<p>Our virtue easily subdu'd; but free</p>
<p>From his incitements and defeat his wiles.</p>
<p>This last petition, dearest Lord! is made</p>
<p>Not for ourselves, since that were needless now,</p>
<p>But for their sakes who after us remain.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Thus for themselves and us good speed imploring,</p>
<p>Those spirits went beneath a weight like that</p>
<p>We sometimes feel in dreams, all, sore beset,</p>
<p>But with unequal anguish, wearied all,</p>
<p>Round the first circuit, purging as they go,</p>
<p>The world's gross darkness off: In our behalf</p>
<p>If there vows still be offer'd, what can here</p>
<p>For them be vow'd and done by such, whose wills</p>

<p>Toward the ladder leads the shortest way.</p>
<p>And if there be more passages than one,</p>
<p>Instruct us of that easiest to ascend;</p>
<p>For this man who comes with me, and bears yet</p>
<p>The charge of fleshly raiment Adam left him,</p>
<p>Despite his better will but slowly mounts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From whom the answer came unto these words,</p>
<p>Which my guide spake, appear'd not; but 'twas said</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Along the bank to rightward come with us,</p>
<p>And ye shall find a pass that mocks not toil</p>
<p>Of living man to climb: and were it not</p>
<p>That I am hinder'd by the rock, wherewith</p>
<p>This arrogant neck is tam'd, whence needs I stoop</p>
<p>My visage to the ground, him, who yet lives,</p>
<p>Whose name thou speak'st not him I fain would view.</p>
<p>To mark if e'er I knew him? and to crave</p>
<p>His pity for the fardel that I bear.</p>
<p>I was of Latiun, of a Tuscan horn</p>
<p>A mighty one: Aldobranlesco's name</p>
<p>My sire's, I know not if ye e'er have heard.</p>
<p>My old blood and forefathers' gallant deeds</p>
<p>Made me so haughty, that I clean forgot</p>
<p>The common mother, and to such excess,</p>
<p>Wax'd in my scorn of all men, that I fell,</p>
<p>Fell therefore; by what fate Sienna's sons,</p>
<p>Each child in Campagnatico, can tell.</p>
<p>I am Omberto; not me only pride</p>
<p>Hath injur'd, but my kindred all involv'd</p>
<p>In mischief with her. Here my lot ordains</p>
<p>Under this weight to groan, till I appease</p>
<p>God's angry justice, since I did it not</p>
<p>Amongst the living, here amongst the dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">List'ning I bent my visage down: and one</p>
<p>(Not he who spake) twisted beneath the weight</p>
<p>That urg'd him, saw me, knew me straight, and call'd,</p>
<p>Holding his eyes With difficulty fix'd</p>
<p>Intent upon me, stooping as I went</p>
<p>Companion of their way. "O!&rdquo; I exclaim'd,</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Art thou not Oderigi, art not thou</p>
<p>Agobbio's glory, glory of that art</p>
<p>Which they of Paris call the limmer's skill?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Brother!&rdquo; said he, "with tints that gayer smile,</p>
<p>Bolognian Franco's pencil lines the leaves.</p>
<p>His all the honour now; mine borrow'd light.</p>
<p>In truth I had not been thus courteous to him,</p>
<p>The whilst I liv'd, through eagerness of zeal</p>
<p>For that pre-eminence my heart was bent on.</p>
<p>Here of such pride the forfeiture is paid.</p>
<p>Nor were I even here; if, able still</p>
<p>To sin, I had not turn'd me unto God.</p>
<p>O powers of man! how vain your glory, nipp'd</p>
<p>E'en in its height of verdure, if an age</p>
<p>Less bright succeed not! Cimabue thought</p>
<p>To lord it over painting's field; and now</p>
<p>The cry is Giotto's, and his name eclips'd.</p>
<p>Thus hath one Guido from the other snatch'd</p>
<p>The letter'd prize: and he perhaps is born,</p>
<p>Who shall drive either from their nest. The noise</p>
<p>Of worldly fame is but a blast of wind,</p>
<p>That blows from divers points, and shifts its name</p>
<p>Shifting the point it blows from. Shalt thou more</p>
<p>Live in the mouths of mankind, if thy flesh</p>
<p>Part shrivel'd from thee, than if thou hadst died,</p>
<p>Before the coral and the pap were left,</p>
<p>Or ere some thousand years have passed? and that</p>
<p>Is, to eternity compar'd, a space,</p>
<p>Briefer than is the twinkling of an eye</p>
<p>To the heaven's slowest orb. He there who treads</p>
<p>So leisurely before me, far and wide</p>
<p>Through Tuscany resounded once; and now</p>
<p>Is in Sienna scarce with whispers nam'd:</p>
<p>There was he sov'reign, when destruction caught</p>
<p>The madd'ning rage of Florence, in that day</p>
<p>Proud as she now is loathsome. Your renown</p>
<p>Is as the herb, whose hue doth come and go,</p>
<p>And his might withers it, by whom it sprang</p>
<p>Crude from the lap of earth.&rdquo; I thus to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;True are thy sayings: to my heart they breathe</p>
<p>The kindly spirit of meekness, and allay</p>
<p>What tumours rankle there. But who is he</p>
<p>Of whom thou spak'st but now?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;This,&rdquo; he replied,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Provenzano. He is here, because</p>
<p>He reach'd, with grasp presumptuous, at the sway</p>
<p>Of all Sienna. Thus he still hath gone,</p>
<p>Thus goeth never-resting, since he died.</p>
<p>Such is th' acquittance render'd back of him,</p>
<p>Who, beyond measure, dar'd on earth.&rdquo; I then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If soul that to the verge of life delays</p>
<p>Repentance, linger in that lower space,</p>
<p>Nor hither mount, unless good prayers befriend,</p>
<p>How chanc'd admittance was vouchsaf'd to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;When at his glory's topmost height,&rdquo; said he,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Respect of dignity all cast aside,</p>
<p>Freely He fix'd him on Sienna's plain,</p>
<p>A suitor to redeem his suff'ring friend,</p>
<p>Who languish'd in the prison-house of Charles,</p>
<p>Nor for his sake refus'd through every vein</p>
<p>To tremble. More I will not say; and dark,</p>
<p>I know, my words are, but thy neighbours soon</p>
<p>Shall help thee to a comment on the text.</p>

`<p class="cantohead">CANTO XII</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>With equal pace as oxen in the yoke,</p>
<p>I with that laden spirit journey'd on</p>
<p>Long as the mild instructor suffer'd me;</p>
<p>But when he bade me quit him, and proceed</p>
<p>(For "here,&rdquo; said he, "behooves with sail and oars</p>
<p>Each man, as best he may, push on his bark"),</p>
<p>Upright, as one dispos'd for speed, I rais'd</p>
<p>My body, still in thought submissive bow'd.</p>
<p class="slindent">I now my leader's track not loth pursued;</p>
<p>And each had shown how light we far'd along</p>
<p>When thus he warn'd me: "Bend thine eyesight down:</p>
<p>For thou to ease the way shall find it good</p>
<p>To ruminate the bed beneath thy feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">As in memorial of the buried, drawn</p>
<p>Upon earth-level tombs, the sculptur'd form</p>
<p>Of what was once, appears (at sight whereof</p>
<p>Tears often stream forth by remembrance wak'd,</p>
<p>Whose sacred stings the piteous only feel),</p>
<p>So saw I there, but with more curious skill</p>
<p>Of portraiture o'erwrought, whate'er of space</p>
<p>From forth the mountain stretches. On one part</p>
<p>Him I beheld, above all creatures erst</p>
<p>Created noblest, light'ning fall from heaven:</p>
<p>On th' other side with bolt celestial pierc'd</p>
<p>Briareus: cumb'ring earth he lay through dint</p>
<p>Of mortal ice-stroke. The Thymbraean god</p>
<p>With Mars, I saw, and Pallas, round their sire,</p>
<p>Arm'd still, and gazing on the giant's limbs</p>
<p>Strewn o'er th' ethereal field. Nimrod I saw:</p>
<p>At foot of the stupendous work he stood,</p>
<p>As if bewilder'd, looking on the crowd</p>
<p>Leagued in his proud attempt on Sennaar's plain.</p>
<p class="slindent">O Niobe! in what a trance of woe</p>
<p>Thee I beheld, upon that highway drawn,</p>
<p>Sev'n sons on either side thee slain! O Saul!</p>
<p>How ghastly didst thou look! on thine own sword</p>
<p>Expiring in Gilboa, from that hour</p>
<p>Ne'er visited with rain from heav'n or dew!</p>
<p class="slindent">O fond Arachne! thee I also saw</p>
<p>Half spider now in anguish crawling up</p>
<p>Th' unfinish'd web thou weaved'st to thy bane!</p>
<p class="slindent">O Rehoboam! here thy shape doth seem</p>
<p>Louring no more defiance! but fear-smote</p>
<p>With none to chase him in his chariot whirl'd.</p>
<p class="slindent">Was shown beside upon the solid floor</p>
<p>How dear Alcmaeon forc'd his mother rate</p>
<p>That ornament in evil hour receiv'd:</p>
<p>How in the temple on Sennacherib fell</p>
<p>His sons, and how a corpse they left him there.</p>
<p>Was shown the scath and cruel mangling made</p>
<p>By Tomyris on Cyrus, when she cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blood thou didst thirst for, take thy fill of blood!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Was shown how routed in the battle fled</p>
<p>Th' Assyrians, Holofernes slain, and e'en</p>
<p>The relics of the carnage. Troy I mark'd</p>
<p>In ashes and in caverns. Oh! how fall'n,</p>
<p>How abject, Ilion, was thy semblance there!</p>
<p class="slindent">What master of the pencil or the style</p>
<p>Had trac'd the shades and lines, that might have made</p>
<p>The subtlest workman wonder? Dead the dead,</p>
<p>The living seem'd alive; with clearer view</p>
<p>His eye beheld not who beheld the truth,</p>
<p>Than mine what I did tread on, while I went</p>
<p>Low bending. Now swell out; and with stiff necks</p>
<p>Pass on, ye sons of Eve! veil not your looks,</p>
<p>Lest they descry the evil of your path!</p>
<p class="slindent">I noted not (so busied was my thought)</p>
<p>How much we now had circled of the mount,</p>
<p>And of his course yet more the sun had spent,</p>
<p>When he, who with still wakeful caution went,</p>
<p>Admonish'd: "Raise thou up thy head: for know</p>
<p>Time is not now for slow suspense. Behold</p>
<p>That way an angel hasting towards us! Lo</p>
<p>Where duly the sixth handmaid doth return</p>
<p>From service on the day. Wear thou in look</p>
<p>And gesture seemly grace of reverent awe,</p>
<p>That gladly he may forward us aloft.</p>
<p>Consider that this day ne'er dawns again.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Time's loss he had so often warn'd me 'gainst,</p>
<p>I could not miss the scope at which he aim'd.</p>
<p class="slindent">The goodly shape approach'd us, snowy white</p>
<p>In vesture, and with visage casting streams</p>
<p>Of tremulous lustre like the matin star.</p>
<p>His arms he open'd, then his wings; and spake:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Onward: the steps, behold! are near; and now</p>
<p>Th' ascent is without difficulty gain'd.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">A scanty few are they, who when they hear</p>
<p>Such tidings, hasten. O ye race of men</p>
<p>Though born to soar, why suffer ye a wind</p>
<p>So slight to baffle ye? He led us on</p>
<p>Where the rock parted; here against my front</p>
<p>Did beat his wings, then promis'd I should fare</p>
<p>In safety on my way. As to ascend</p>
<p>That steep, upon whose brow the chapel stands</p>
<p>(O'er Rubaconte, looking lordly down</p>
<p>On the well-guided city,) up the right</p>
<p>Th' impetuous rise is broken by the steps</p>
<p>Carv'd in that old and simple age, when still</p>
<p>The registry and label rested safe;</p>
<p>Thus is th' acclivity reliev'd, which here</p>
<p>Precipitous from the other circuit falls:</p>
<p>But on each hand the tall cliff presses close.</p>
<p class="slindent">As ent'ring there we turn'd, voices, in strain</p>
<p>Ineffable, sang: "Blessed are the poor</p>
<p>In spirit.&rdquo; Ah how far unlike to these</p>
<p>The straits of hell; here songs to usher us,</p>
<p>There shrieks of woe! We climb the holy stairs:</p>
<p>And lighter to myself by far I seem'd</p>
<p>Than on the plain before, whence thus I spake:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, master, of what heavy thing have I</p>
<p>Been lighten'd, that scarce aught the sense of toil</p>
<p>Affects me journeying?&rdquo; He in few replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When sin's broad characters, that yet remain</p>
<p>Upon thy temples, though well nigh effac'd,</p>
<p>Shall be, as one is, all clean razed out,</p>
<p>Then shall thy feet by heartiness of will</p>
<p>Be so o'ercome, they not alone shall feel</p>
<p>No sense of labour, but delight much more</p>
<p>Shall wait them urg'd along their upward way.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Then like to one, upon whose head is plac'd</p>
<p>Somewhat he deems not of but from the becks</p>
<p>Of others as they pass him by; his hand</p>
<p>Lends therefore help to' assure him, searches, finds,</p>
<p>And well performs such office as the eye</p>
<p>Wants power to execute: so stretching forth</p>
<p>The fingers of my right hand, did I find</p>
<p>Six only of the letters, which his sword</p>
<p>Who bare the keys had trac'd upon my brow.</p>
<p>The leader, as he mark'd mine action, smil'd.</p>
</div>`,

`<p class="cantohead">CANTO XIII</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>We reach'd the summit of the scale, and stood</p>
<p>Upon the second buttress of that mount</p>
<p>Which healeth him who climbs. A cornice there,</p>
<p>Like to the former, girdles round the hill;</p>
<p>Save that its arch with sweep less ample bends.</p>
<p class="slindent">Shadow nor image there is seen; all smooth</p>
<p>The rampart and the path, reflecting nought</p>
<p>But the rock's sullen hue. "If here we wait</p>
<p>For some to question,&rdquo; said the bard, "I fear</p>
<p>Our choice may haply meet too long delay.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Then fixedly upon the sun his eyes</p>
<p>He fastn'd, made his right the central point</p>
<p>From whence to move, and turn'd the left aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O pleasant light, my confidence and hope,</p>
<p>Conduct us thou,&rdquo; he cried, "on this new way,</p>
<p>Where now I venture, leading to the bourn</p>
<p>We seek. The universal world to thee</p>
<p>Owes warmth and lustre. If no other cause</p>
<p>Forbid, thy beams should ever be our guide.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Far, as is measur'd for a mile on earth,</p>
<p>In brief space had we journey'd; such prompt will</p>
<p>Impell'd; and towards us flying, now were heard</p>
<p>Spirits invisible, who courteously</p>
<p>Unto love's table bade the welcome guest.</p>
<p>The voice, that first? flew by, call'd forth aloud,</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have no wine; &rdquo; so on behind us past,</p>
<p>Those sounds reiterating, nor yet lost</p>
<p>In the faint distance, when another came</p>
<p>Crying, "I am Orestes,&rdquo; and alike</p>
<p>Wing'd its fleet way. "Oh father!&rdquo; I exclaim'd,</p>
<p>&ldquo;What tongues are these?&rdquo; and as I question'd, lo!</p>
<p>A third exclaiming, "Love ye those have wrong'd you.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;This circuit,&rdquo; said my teacher, "knots the scourge</p>
<p>For envy, and the cords are therefore drawn</p>
<p>By charity's correcting hand. The curb</p>
<p>Is of a harsher sound, as thou shalt hear</p>
<p>(If I deem rightly), ere thou reach the pass,</p>
<p>Where pardon sets them free. But fix thine eyes</p>
<p>Intently through the air, and thou shalt see</p>
<p>A multitude before thee seated, each</p>
<p>Along the shelving grot.&rdquo; Then more than erst</p>
<p>I op'd my eyes, before me view'd, and saw</p>
<p>Shadows with garments dark as was the rock;</p>
<p>And when we pass'd a little forth, I heard</p>
<p>A crying, "Blessed Mary! pray for us,</p>
<p>Michael and Peter! all ye saintly host!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">I do not think there walks on earth this day</p>
<p>Man so remorseless, that he hath not yearn'd</p>
<p>With pity at the sight that next I saw.</p>
<p>Mine eyes a load of sorrow teemed, when now</p>
<p>I stood so near them, that their semblances</p>
<p>Came clearly to my view. Of sackcloth vile</p>
<p>Their cov'ring seem'd; and on his shoulder one</p>
<p>Did stay another, leaning, and all lean'd</p>
<p>Against the cliff. E'en thus the blind and poor,</p>
<p>Near the confessionals, to crave an alms,</p>
<p>Stand, each his head upon his fellow's sunk,</p>
<p>So most to stir compassion, not by sound</p>
<p>Of words alone, but that, which moves not less,</p>
<p>The sight of mis'ry. And as never beam</p>
<p>Of noonday visiteth the eyeless man,</p>
<p>E'en so was heav'n a niggard unto these</p>
<p>Of his fair light; for, through the orbs of all,</p>
<p>A thread of wire, impiercing, knits them up,</p>
<p>As for the taming of a haggard hawk.</p>
<p class="slindent">It were a wrong, methought, to pass and look</p>
<p>On others, yet myself the while unseen.</p>
<p>To my sage counsel therefore did I turn.</p>
<p>He knew the meaning of the mute appeal,</p>
<p>Nor waited for my questioning, but said:</p>

<p class="slindent">On that part of the cornice, whence no rim</p>
<p>Engarlands its steep fall, did Virgil come;</p>
<p>On the' other side me were the spirits, their cheeks</p>
<p>Bathing devout with penitential tears,</p>
<p>That through the dread impalement forc'd a way.</p>
<p class="slindent">I turn'd me to them, and "O shades!&rdquo; said I,</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Assur'd that to your eyes unveil'd shall shine</p>

<p>The stream of mind roll limpid from its source,</p>
<p>As ye declare (for so shall ye impart</p>
<p>A boon I dearly prize) if any soul</p>
<p>Of Latium dwell among ye; and perchance</p>
<p>That soul may profit, if I learn so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;My brother, we are each one citizens</p>
<p>Of one true city. Any thou wouldst say,</p>
<p>Who lived a stranger in Italia's land.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">So heard I answering, as appeal'd, a voice</p>
<p>That onward came some space from whence I stood.</p>
<p class="slindent">A spirit I noted, in whose look was mark'd</p>
<p>Expectance. Ask ye how? The chin was rais'd</p>
<p>As in one reft of sight. "Spirit,&rdquo; said I,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who for thy rise are tutoring (if thou be</p>
<p>That which didst answer to me,) or by place</p>
<p>Or name, disclose thyself, that I may know thee.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Soliciting with tears that He, who is,</p>
<p>Vouchsafe him to us. Though Sapia nam'd</p>

<p>Of others' hurt, than of the good befell me.</p>
<p>That thou mayst own I now deceive thee not,</p>
<p>Hear, if my folly were not as I speak it.</p>
<p>When now my years slop'd waning down the arch,</p>
<p>It so bechanc'd, my fellow citizens</p>
<p>Near Colle met their enemies in the field,</p>
<p>And I pray'd God to grant what He had will'd.</p>
<p>There were they vanquish'd, and betook themselves</p>
<p>Unto the bitter passages of flight.</p>
<p>I mark'd the hunt, and waxing out of bounds</p>
<p>In gladness, lifted up my shameless brow,</p>
<p>And like the merlin cheated by a gleam,</p>
<p>Cried, "It is over. Heav'n! I fear thee not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Upon my verge of life I wish'd for peace</p>
<p>With God; nor repentance had supplied</p>
<p>What I did lack of duty, were it not</p>
<p>The hermit Piero, touch'd with charity,</p>
<p>In his devout orisons thought on me.</p>
<p>But who art thou that question'st of our state,</p>
<p>Who go'st to my belief, with lids unclos'd,</p>
<p>And breathest in thy talk?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Mine eyes," said I,</p>
<p>&ldquo;May yet be here ta'en from me; but not long;</p>
<p>For they have not offended grievously</p>
<p>With envious glances. But the woe beneath</p>
<p>Urges my soul with more exceeding dread.</p>
<p>That nether load already weighs me down.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">She thus: "Who then amongst us here aloft</p>
<p>Hath brought thee, if thou weenest to return?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;He," answer'd I, "who standeth mute beside me.</p>
<p>I live: of me ask therefore, chosen spirit,</p>
<p>If thou desire I yonder yet should move</p>
<p>For thee my mortal feet." &mdash;&ldquo;Oh!" she replied,</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is so strange a thing, it is great sign</p>
<p>That God doth love thee. Therefore with thy prayer</p>
<p>Sometime assist me: and by that I crave,</p>
<p>Which most thou covetest, that if thy feet</p>
<p>E'er tread on Tuscan soil, thou save my fame</p>
<p>Amongst my kindred. Them shalt thou behold</p>
<p>With that vain multitude, who set their hope</p>
<p>On Telamone's haven, there to fail</p>

<p class="slindent">Thus on the right two Spirits bending each</p>
<p>Toward the other, talk'd of me, then both</p>
<p>Addressing me, their faces backward lean'd,</p>
<p>And thus the one began: "O soul, who yet</p>
<p>Pent in the body, tendest towards the sky!</p>
<p>For charity, we pray thee' comfort us,</p>
<p>Recounting whence thou com'st, and who thou art:</p>

<p>Marvel, as at a thing that ne'er hath been.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;There stretches through the midst of Tuscany,</p>
<p>I straight began: "a brooklet, whose well-head</p>

<p>Not satisfied, when he some hundred miles</p>
<p>Hath measur'd. From his banks bring, I this frame.</p>

<p>For yet my name scarce sounds on rumour's lip.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;If well I do incorp'rate with my thought</p>

<p>The title of that river, as a man</p>
<p>Doth of some horrible thing?" The spirit, who</p>
<p>Thereof was question'd, did acquit him thus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know not: but 'tis fitting well the name</p>
<p>Should perish of that vale; for from the source</p>
<p>Where teems so plenteously the Alpine steep</p>
<p>Maim'd of Pelorus, (that doth scarcely pass</p>
<p>Beyond that limit,) even to the point</p>
<p>Whereunto ocean is restor'd, what heaven</p>
<p>Drains from th' exhaustless store for all earth's streams,</p>
<p>Throughout the space is virtue worried down,</p>
<p>As 'twere a snake, by all, for mortal foe,</p>
<p>Or through disastrous influence on the place,</p>
<p>Or else distortion of misguided wills,</p>
<p>That custom goads to evil: whence in those,</p>
<p>The dwellers in that miserable vale,</p>
<p>Nature is so transform'd, it seems as they</p>
<p>Had shar'd of Circe's feeding. 'Midst brute swine,</p>
<p>Worthier of acorns than of other food</p>
<p>Created for man's use, he shapeth first</p>
<p>His obscure way; then, sloping onward, finds</p>
<p>Curs, snarlers more in spite than power, from whom</p>
<p>He turns with scorn aside: still journeying down,</p>
<p>By how much more the curst and luckless foss</p>
<p>Swells out to largeness, e'en so much it finds</p>
<p>Dogs turning into wolves. Descending still</p>
<p>Through yet more hollow eddies, next he meets</p>
<p>A race of foxes, so replete with craft,</p>
<p>They do not fear that skill can master it.</p>
<p>Nor will I cease because my words are heard</p>
<p>By other ears than thine. It shall be well</p>
<p>For this man, if he keep in memory</p>
<p>What from no erring Spirit I reveal.</p>
<p>Lo! I behold thy grandson, that becomes</p>
<p>A hunter of those wolves, upon the shore</p>
<p>Of the fierce stream, and cows them all with dread:</p>
<p>Their flesh yet living sets he up to sale,</p>
<p>Then like an aged beast to slaughter dooms.</p>
<p>Many of life he reaves, himself of worth</p>
<p>And goodly estimation. Smear'd with gore</p>
<p>Mark how he issues from the rueful wood,</p>
<p>Leaving such havoc, that in thousand years</p>
<p>It spreads not to prime lustihood again.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">As one, who tidings hears of woe to come,</p>
<p>Changes his looks perturb'd, from whate'er part</p>
<p>The peril grasp him, so beheld I change</p>
<p>That spirit, who had turn'd to listen, struck</p>
<p>With sadness, soon as he had caught the word.</p>
<p class="slindent">His visage and the other's speech did raise</p>
<p>Desire in me to know the names of both,</p>
<p>whereof with meek entreaty I inquir'd.</p>
<p class="slindent">The shade, who late addrest me, thus resum'd:</p>

<p>His grace in thee, I will be liberal too.</p>

<p>Envy so parch'd my blood, that had I seen</p>
<p>A fellow man made joyous, thou hadst mark'd</p>
<p>A livid paleness overspread my cheek.</p>
<p>Such harvest reap I of the seed I sow'd.</p>
<p>O man, why place thy heart where there doth need</p>
<p>Exclusion of participants in good?</p>
<p>This is Rinieri's spirit, this the boast</p>
<p>And honour of the house of Calboli,</p>
<p>Where of his worth no heritage remains.</p>
<p>Nor his the only blood, that hath been stript</p>
<p>('twixt Po, the mount, the Reno, and the shore,)</p>
<p>Of all that truth or fancy asks for bliss;</p>
<p>But in those limits such a growth has sprung</p>
<p>Of rank and venom'd roots, as long would mock</p>
<p>Slow culture's toil. Where is good Lizio? where</p>
<p>Manardi, Traversalo, and Carpigna?</p>
<p>O bastard slips of old Romagna's line!</p>
<p>When in Bologna the low artisan,</p>
<p>And in Faenza yon Bernardin sprouts,</p>
<p>A gentle cyon from ignoble stem.</p>
<p>Wonder not, Tuscan, if thou see me weep,</p>
<p>When I recall to mind those once lov'd names,</p>
<p>Guido of Prata, and of Azzo him</p>
<p>That dwelt with you; Tignoso and his troop,</p>
<p>With Traversaro's house and Anastagio s,</p>
<p>(Each race disherited) and beside these,</p>
<p>The ladies and the knights, the toils and ease,</p>
<p>That witch'd us into love and courtesy;</p>
<p>Where now such malice reigns in recreant hearts.</p>
<p>O Brettinoro! wherefore tarriest still,</p>
<p>Since forth of thee thy family hath gone,</p>
<p>And many, hating evil, join'd their steps?</p>
<p>Well doeth he, that bids his lineage cease,</p>
<p>Bagnacavallo; Castracaro ill,</p>
<p>And Conio worse, who care to propagate</p>
<p>A race of Counties from such blood as theirs.</p>
<p>Well shall ye also do, Pagani, then</p>
<p>When from amongst you tries your demon child.</p>
<p>Not so, howe'er, that henceforth there remain</p>
<p>True proof of what ye were. O Hugolin!</p>
<p>Thou sprung of Fantolini's line! thy name</p>
<p>Is safe, since none is look'd for after thee</p>
<p>To cloud its lustre, warping from thy stock.</p>
<p>But, Tuscan, go thy ways; for now I take</p>
<p>Far more delight in weeping than in words.</p>
<p>Such pity for your sakes hath wrung my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">We knew those gentle spirits at parting heard</p>
<p>Our steps. Their silence therefore of our way</p>
<p>Assur'd us. Soon as we had quitted them,</p>
<p>Advancing onward, lo! a voice that seem'd</p>
<p>Like vollied light'ning, when it rives the air,</p>
<p>Met us, and shouted, "Whosoever finds</p>
<p>Will slay me," then fled from us, as the bolt</p>
<p>Lanc'd sudden from a downward-rushing cloud.</p>
<p>When it had giv'n short truce unto our hearing,</p>
<p>Behold the other with a crash as loud</p>
<p>As the quick-following thunder: "Mark in me</p>
<p>Aglauros turn'd to rock." I at the sound</p>
<p>Retreating drew more closely to my guide.</p>
<p class="slindent">Now in mute stillness rested all the air:</p>
<p>And thus he spake: "There was the galling bit.</p>

<p>He drags you eager to him. Hence nor curb</p>
<p>Avails you, nor reclaiming call. Heav'n calls</p>
<p>And round about you wheeling courts your gaze</p>
<p>With everlasting beauties. Yet your eye</p>

`<p class="cantohead">CANTO XV</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>As much as 'twixt the third hour's close and dawn,</p>
<p>Appeareth of heav'n's sphere, that ever whirls</p>
<p>As restless as an infant in his play,</p>
<p>So much appear'd remaining to the sun</p>
<p>Of his slope journey towards the western goal.</p>
<p class="slindent">Evening was there, and here the noon of night;</p>
<p>and full upon our forehead smote the beams.</p>
<p>For round the mountain, circling, so our path</p>
<p>Had led us, that toward the sun-set now</p>
<p>Direct we journey'd: when I felt a weight</p>
<p>Of more exceeding splendour, than before,</p>
<p>Press on my front. The cause unknown, amaze</p>
<p>Possess'd me, and both hands against my brow</p>
<p>Lifting, I interpos'd them, as a screen,</p>
<p>That of its gorgeous superflux of light</p>
<p>Clipp'd the diminish'd orb. As when the ray,</p>
<p>Striking On water or the surface clear</p>
<p>Of mirror, leaps unto the opposite part,</p>
<p>Ascending at a glance, e'en as it fell,</p>
<p>(And so much differs from the stone, that falls</p>
<p>Through equal space, as practice skill hath shown;</p>
<p>Thus with refracted light before me seemed</p>
<p>The ground there smitten; whence in sudden haste</p>
<p>My sight recoil'd. "What is this, sire belov'd!</p>
<p>'Gainst which I strive to shield the sight in vain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cried I, "and which towards us moving seems?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Marvel not, if the family of heav'n,&rdquo;</p>
<p>He answer'd, "yet with dazzling radiance dim</p>
<p>Thy sense it is a messenger who comes,</p>
<p>Inviting man's ascent. Such sights ere long,</p>
<p>Not grievous, shall impart to thee delight,</p>
<p>As thy perception is by nature wrought</p>
<p>Up to their pitch." The blessed angel, soon</p>
<p>As we had reach'd him, hail'd us with glad voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here enter on a ladder far less steep</p>
<p>Than ye have yet encounter'd." We forthwith</p>
<p>Ascending, heard behind us chanted sweet,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blessed the merciful," and "happy thou!</p>
<p>That conquer'st." Lonely each, my guide and I</p>
<p>Pursued our upward way; and as we went,</p>
<p>Some profit from his words I hop'd to win,</p>
<p>And thus of him inquiring, fram'd my speech:</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;What meant Romagna's spirit, when he spake</p>
<p>Of bliss exclusive with no partner shar'd?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">He straight replied: "No wonder, since he knows,</p>
<p>What sorrow waits on his own worst defect,</p>
<p>If he chide others, that they less may mourn.</p>
<p>Because ye point your wishes at a mark,</p>
<p>Where, by communion of possessors, part</p>
<p>Is lessen'd, envy bloweth up the sighs of men.</p>
<p>No fear of that might touch ye, if the love</p>
<p>Of higher sphere exalted your desire.</p>
<p>For there, by how much more they call it ours,</p>
<p>So much propriety of each in good</p>
<p>Increases more, and heighten'd charity</p>
<p>Wraps that fair cloister in a brighter flame.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Now lack I satisfaction more," said I,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Than if thou hadst been silent at the first,</p>
<p>And doubt more gathers on my lab'ring thought.</p>
<p>How can it chance, that good distributed,</p>
<p>The many, that possess it, makes more rich,</p>
<p>Than if 't were shar'd by few?" He answering thus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thy mind, reverting still to things of earth,</p>
<p>Strikes darkness from true light. The highest good</p>
<p>Unlimited, ineffable, doth so speed</p>
<p>To love, as beam to lucid body darts,</p>
<p>Giving as much of ardour as it finds.</p>
<p>The sempiternal effluence streams abroad</p>
<p>Spreading, wherever charity extends.</p>
<p>So that the more aspirants to that bliss</p>
<p>Are multiplied, more good is there to love,</p>
<p>And more is lov'd; as mirrors, that reflect,</p>
<p>Each unto other, propagated light.</p>
<p>If these my words avail not to allay</p>
<p>Thy thirsting, Beatrice thou shalt see,</p>
<p>Who of this want, and of all else thou hast,</p>
<p>Shall rid thee to the full. Provide but thou</p>
<p>That from thy temples may be soon eras'd,</p>

<p>That when they pain thee worst, then kindliest heal,&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Thou," I had said, "content'st me," when I saw</p>
<p>The other round was gain'd, and wond'ring eyes</p>
<p>Did keep me mute. There suddenly I seem'd</p>
<p>By an ecstatic vision wrapt away;</p>
<p>And in a temple saw, methought, a crowd</p>
<p>Of many persons; and at th' entrance stood</p>
<p>A dame, whose sweet demeanour did express</p>
<p>A mother's love, who said, "Child! why hast thou</p>
<p>Dealt with us thus? Behold thy sire and I</p>
<p>Sorrowing have sought thee;" and so held her peace,</p>
<p>And straight the vision fled. A female next</p>
<p>Appear'd before me, down whose visage cours'd</p>
<p>Those waters, that grief forces out from one</p>
<p>By deep resentment stung, who seem'd to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If thou, Pisistratus, be lord indeed</p>
<p>Over this city, nam'd with such debate</p>
<p>Of adverse gods, and whence each science sparkles,</p>
<p>Avenge thee of those arms, whose bold embrace</p>
<p>Hath clasp'd our daughter; "and to fuel, meseem'd,</p>
<p>Benign and meek, with visage undisturb'd,</p>
<p>Her sovran spake: "How shall we those requite,</p>
<p>Who wish us evil, if we thus condemn</p>
<p>The man that loves us?" After that I saw</p>
<p>A multitude, in fury burning, slay</p>
<p>With stones a stripling youth, and shout amain</p>
<p>&ldquo;Destroy, destroy: "and him I saw, who bow'd</p>
<p>Heavy with death unto the ground, yet made</p>
<p>His eyes, unfolded upward, gates to heav'n,</p>
<p>Praying forgiveness of th' Almighty Sire,</p>
<p>Amidst that cruel conflict, on his foes,</p>
<p>With looks, that With compassion to their aim.</p>
<p class="slindent">Soon as my spirit, from her airy flight</p>
<p>Returning, sought again the things, whose truth</p>
<p>Depends not on her shaping, I observ'd</p>
<p>How she had rov'd to no unreal scenes</p>
<p class="slindent">Meanwhile the leader, who might see I mov'd,</p>
<p>As one, who struggles to shake off his sleep,</p>
<p>Exclaim'd: "What ails thee, that thou canst not hold</p>
<p>Thy footing firm, but more than half a league</p>
<p>Hast travel'd with clos'd eyes and tott'ring gait,</p>
<p>Like to a man by wine or sleep o'ercharg'd?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Beloved father! so thou deign," said I,</p>
<p>&ldquo;To listen, I will tell thee what appear'd</p>
<p>Before me, when so fail'd my sinking steps.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">He thus: "Not if thy Countenance were mask'd</p>
<p>With hundred vizards, could a thought of thine</p>
<p>How small soe'er, elude me. What thou saw'st</p>
<p>Was shown, that freely thou mightst ope thy heart</p>
<p>To the waters of peace, that flow diffus'd</p>
<p>From their eternal fountain. I not ask'd,</p>
<p>What ails thee? for such cause as he doth, who</p>
<p>Looks only with that eye which sees no more,</p>
<p>When spiritless the body lies; but ask'd,</p>
<p>To give fresh vigour to thy foot. Such goads</p>
<p>The slow and loit'ring need; that they be found</p>
<p>Not wanting, when their hour of watch returns.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">So on we journey'd through the evening sky</p>
<p>Gazing intent, far onward, as our eyes</p>
<p>With level view could stretch against the bright</p>
<p>Vespertine ray: and lo! by slow degrees</p>
<p>Gath'ring, a fog made tow'rds us, dark as night.</p>
<p>There was no room for 'scaping; and that mist</p>
<p>Bereft us, both of sight and the pure air.</p>

<p>So palpable and gross. Ent'ring its shade,</p>
<p>Mine eye endured not with unclosed lids;</p>

<p class="slindent">As the blind man behind his leader walks,</p>
<p>Lest he should err, or stumble unawares</p>

<p>I journey'd through that bitter air and foul,</p>
<p>Still list'ning to my escort's warning voice,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look that from me thou part not." Straight I heard</p>
<p>Voices, and each one seem'd to pray for peace,</p>
<p>And for compassion, to the Lamb of God</p>
<p>That taketh sins away. Their prelude still</p>
<p>Was "Agnus Dei," and through all the choir,</p>
<p>One voice, one measure ran, that perfect seem'd</p>
<p>The concord of their song. "Are these I hear</p>
<p>Spirits, O master?" I exclaim'd; and he:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou aim'st aright: these loose the bonds of wrath.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Now who art thou, that through our smoke dost cleave?</p>
<p>And speak'st of us, as thou thyself e'en yet</p>

<p>And ask, if upward hence the passage lead.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;O being! who dost make thee pure, to stand</p>
<p>Beautiful once more in thy Maker's sight!</p>

<p>Thus I, whereto the spirit answering spake:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long as 't is lawful for me, shall my steps</p>
<p>Follow on thine; and since the cloudy smoke</p>
<p>Forbids the seeing, hearing in its stead</p>
<p>Shall keep us join'd." I then forthwith began</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet in my mortal swathing, I ascend</p>

<p>Of all good as thou speak'st it and so swarms</p>
<p>With every evil. Yet, beseech thee, point</p>
<p>The cause out to me, that myself may see,</p>
<p>And unto others show it: for in heaven</p>
<p>One places it, and one on earth below.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Then heaving forth a deep and audible sigh,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brother!" he thus began, "the world is blind;</p>
<p>And thou in truth com'st from it. Ye, who live,</p>
<p>Do so each cause refer to heav'n above,</p>
<p>E'en as its motion of necessity</p>
<p>Drew with it all that moves. If this were so,</p>
<p>Free choice in you were none; nor justice would</p>
<p>There should be joy for virtue, woe for ill.</p>
<p>Your movements have their primal bent from heaven;</p>
<p>Not all; yet said I all; what then ensues?</p>
<p>Light have ye still to follow evil or good,</p>
<p>And of the will free power, which, if it stand</p>
<p>Firm and unwearied in Heav'n's first assay,</p>
<p>Conquers at last, so it be cherish'd well,</p>
<p>Triumphant over all. To mightier force,</p>
<p>To better nature subject, ye abide</p>
<p>Free, not constrain'd by that, which forms in you</p>
<p>The reasoning mind uninfluenc'd of the stars.</p>
<p>If then the present race of mankind err,</p>
<p>Seek in yourselves the cause, and find it there.</p>
<p>Herein thou shalt confess me no false spy.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Forth from his plastic hand, who charm'd beholds</p>
<p>Her image ere she yet exist, the soul</p>
<p>Comes like a babe, that wantons sportively</p>
<p>Weeping and laughing in its wayward moods,</p>
<p>As artless and as ignorant of aught,</p>
<p>Save that her Maker being one who dwells</p>
<p>With gladness ever, willingly she turns</p>
<p>To whate'er yields her joy. Of some slight good</p>
<p>The flavour soon she tastes; and, snar'd by that,</p>
<p>With fondness she pursues it, if no guide</p>
<p>Recall, no rein direct her wand'ring course.</p>
<p>Hence it behov'd, the law should be a curb;</p>
<p>A sovereign hence behov'd, whose piercing view</p>
<p>Might mark at least the fortress and main tower</p>
<p>Of the true city. Laws indeed there are:</p>
<p>But who is he observes them? None; not he,</p>
<p>Who goes before, the shepherd of the flock,</p>
<p>Who chews the cud but doth not cleave the hoof.</p>
<p>Therefore the multitude, who see their guide</p>
<p>Strike at the very good they covet most,</p>
<p>Feed there and look no further. Thus the cause</p>
<p>Is not corrupted nature in yourselves,</p>
<p>But ill-conducting, that hath turn'd the world</p>
<p>To evil. Rome, that turn'd it unto good,</p>
<p>Was wont to boast two suns, whose several beams</p>
<p>Cast light on either way, the world's and God's.</p>
<p>One since hath quench'd the other; and the sword</p>
<p>Is grafted on the crook; and so conjoin'd</p>
<p>Each must perforce decline to worse, unaw'd</p>
<p>By fear of other. If thou doubt me, mark</p>
<p>The blade: each herb is judg'd of by its seed.</p>
<p>That land, through which Adice and the Po</p>
<p>Their waters roll, was once the residence</p>
<p>Of courtesy and velour, ere the day,</p>
<p>That frown'd on Frederick; now secure may pass</p>
<p>Those limits, whosoe'er hath left, for shame,</p>
<p>To talk with good men, or come near their haunts.</p>
<p>Three aged ones are still found there, in whom</p>
<p>The old time chides the new: these deem it long</p>
<p>Ere God restore them to a better world:</p>
<p>The good Gherardo, of Palazzo he</p>
<p>Conrad, and Guido of Castello, nam'd</p>
<p>In Gallic phrase more fitly the plain Lombard.</p>
<p>On this at last conclude. The church of Rome,</p>
<p>Mixing two governments that ill assort,</p>
<p>Hath miss'd her footing, fall'n into the mire,</p>
<p>And there herself and burden much defil'd.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;O Marco!" I replied, shine arguments</p>
<p>Convince me: and the cause I now discern</p>
<p>Why of the heritage no portion came</p>
<p>To Levi's offspring. But resolve me this</p>
<p>Who that Gherardo is, that as thou sayst</p>
<p>Is left a sample of the perish'd race,</p>
<p>And for rebuke to this untoward age?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Either thy words," said he, "deceive; or else</p>
<p>Are meant to try me; that thou, speaking Tuscan,</p>
<p>Appear'st not to have heard of good Gherado;</p>
<p>The sole addition that, by which I know him;</p>
<p>Unless I borrow'd from his daughter Gaia</p>
<p>Another name to grace him. God be with you.</p>
<p>I bear you company no more. Behold</p>
<p>The dawn with white ray glimm'ring through the mist.</p>
<p>I must away&mdash;the angel comes&mdash;ere he</p>
<p>Appear." He said, and would not hear me more.</p>

`<p class="cantohead">CANTO XVII</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>Call to remembrance, reader, if thou e'er</p>
<p>Hast, on a mountain top, been ta'en by cloud,</p>
<p>Through which thou saw'st no better, than the mole</p>
<p>Doth through opacous membrane; then, whene'er</p>
<p>The wat'ry vapours dense began to melt</p>
<p>Into thin air, how faintly the sun's sphere</p>
<p>Seem'd wading through them; so thy nimble thought</p>
<p>May image, how at first I re-beheld</p>
<p>The sun, that bedward now his couch o'erhung.</p>
<p class="slindent">Thus with my leader's feet still equaling pace</p>
<p>From forth that cloud I came, when now expir'd</p>
<p>The parting beams from off the nether shores.</p>
<p class="slindent">O quick and forgetive power! that sometimes dost</p>
<p>So rob us of ourselves, we take no mark</p>
<p>Though round about us thousand trumpets clang!</p>
<p>What moves thee, if the senses stir not? Light</p>
<p>Kindled in heav'n, spontaneous, self-inform'd,</p>
<p>Or likelier gliding down with swift illapse</p>
<p>By will divine. Portray'd before me came</p>
<p>The traces of her dire impiety,</p>
<p>Whose form was chang'd into the bird, that most</p>
<p>Delights itself in song: and here my mind</p>
<p>Was inwardly so wrapt, it gave no place</p>
<p>To aught that ask'd admittance from without.</p>
<p class="slindent">Next shower'd into my fantasy a shape</p>
<p>As of one crucified, whose visage spake</p>
<p>Fell rancour, malice deep, wherein he died;</p>
<p>And round him Ahasuerus the great king,</p>
<p>Esther his bride, and Mordecai the just,</p>
<p>Blameless in word and deed. As of itself</p>
<p>That unsubstantial coinage of the brain</p>
<p>Burst, like a bubble, Which the water fails</p>
<p>That fed it; in my vision straight uprose</p>
<p>A damsel weeping loud, and cried, "O queen!</p>
<p>O mother! wherefore has intemperate ire</p>
<p>Driv'n thee to loath thy being? Not to lose</p>
<p>Lavinia, desp'rate thou hast slain thyself.</p>
<p>Now hast thou lost me. I am she, whose tears</p>
<p>Mourn, ere I fall, a mother's timeless end.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">E'en as a sleep breaks off, if suddenly</p>
<p>New radiance strike upon the closed lids,</p>
<p>The broken slumber quivering ere it dies;</p>
<p>Thus from before me sunk that imagery</p>
<p>Vanishing, soon as on my face there struck</p>
<p>The light, outshining far our earthly beam.</p>
<p>As round I turn'd me to survey what place</p>
<p>I had arriv'd at, "Here ye mount," exclaim'd</p>
<p>A voice, that other purpose left me none,</p>
<p>Save will so eager to behold who spake,</p>
<p>I could not choose but gaze. As 'fore the sun,</p>
<p>That weighs our vision down, and veils his form</p>
<p>In light transcendent, thus my virtue fail'd</p>
<p>Unequal. "This is Spirit from above,</p>
<p>Who marshals us our upward way, unsought;</p>
<p>And in his own light shrouds him;. As a man</p>
<p>Doth for himself, so now is done for us.</p>
<p>For whoso waits imploring, yet sees need</p>
<p>Of his prompt aidance, sets himself prepar'd</p>
<p>For blunt denial, ere the suit be made.</p>
<p>Refuse we not to lend a ready foot</p>
<p>At such inviting: haste we to ascend,</p>
<p>Before it darken: for we may not then,</p>
<p>Till morn again return." So spake my guide;</p>
<p>And to one ladder both address'd our steps;</p>
<p>And the first stair approaching, I perceiv'd</p>
<p>Near me as 'twere the waving of a wing,</p>
<p>That fann'd my face and whisper'd: "Blessed they</p>
<p>The peacemakers: they know not evil wrath.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Now to such height above our heads were rais'd</p>
<p>The last beams, follow'd close by hooded night,</p>
<p>That many a star on all sides through the gloom</p>
<p>Shone out. "Why partest from me, O my strength?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So with myself I commun'd; for I felt</p>
<p>My o'ertoil'd sinews slacken. We had reach'd</p>
<p>The summit, and were fix'd like to a bark</p>
<p>Arriv'd at land. And waiting a short space,</p>
<p>If aught should meet mine ear in that new round,</p>
<p>Then to my guide I turn'd, and said: "Lov'd sire!</p>
<p>Declare what guilt is on this circle purg'd.</p>
<p>If our feet rest, no need thy speech should pause.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">He thus to me: "The love of good, whate'er</p>
<p>Wanted of just proportion, here fulfils.</p>
<p>Here plies afresh the oar, that loiter'd ill.</p>
<p>But that thou mayst yet clearlier understand,</p>
<p>Give ear unto my words, and thou shalt cull</p>
<p>Some fruit may please thee well, from this delay.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Creator, nor created being, ne'er,</p>
<p>My son," he thus began, "was without love,</p>
<p>Or natural, or the free spirit's growth.</p>
<p>Thou hast not that to learn. The natural still</p>
<p>Is without error; but the other swerves,</p>
<p>If on ill object bent, or through excess</p>
<p>Of vigour, or defect. While e'er it seeks</p>
<p>The primal blessings, or with measure due</p>
<p>Th' inferior, no delight, that flows from it,</p>
<p>Partakes of ill. But let it warp to evil,</p>
<p>Or with more ardour than behooves, or less.</p>
<p>Pursue the good, the thing created then</p>
<p>Works 'gainst its Maker. Hence thou must infer</p>
<p>That love is germin of each virtue in ye,</p>
<p>And of each act no less, that merits pain.</p>
<p>Now since it may not be, but love intend</p>
<p>The welfare mainly of the thing it loves,</p>
<p>All from self-hatred are secure; and since</p>
<p>No being can be thought t' exist apart</p>
<p>And independent of the first, a bar</p>
<p>Of equal force restrains from hating that.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Grant the distinction just; and it remains</p>
<p>The' evil must be another's, which is lov'd.</p>
<p>Three ways such love is gender'd in your clay.</p>
<p>There is who hopes (his neighbour's worth deprest,)</p>
<p>Preeminence himself, and coverts hence</p>
<p>For his own greatness that another fall.</p>
<p>There is who so much fears the loss of power,</p>
<p>Fame, favour, glory (should his fellow mount</p>
<p>Above him), and so sickens at the thought,</p>
<p>He loves their opposite: and there is he,</p>
<p>Whom wrong or insult seems to gall and shame</p>
<p>That he doth thirst for vengeance, and such needs</p>
<p>Must doat on other's evil. Here beneath</p>
<p>This threefold love is mourn'd. Of th' other sort</p>
<p>Be now instructed, that which follows good</p>
<p>But with disorder'd and irregular course.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;All indistinctly apprehend a bliss</p>
<p>On which the soul may rest, the hearts of all</p>
<p>Yearn after it, and to that wished bourn</p>
<p>All therefore strive to tend. If ye behold</p>
<p>Or seek it with a love remiss and lax,</p>
<p>This cornice after just repenting lays</p>
<p>Its penal torment on ye. Other good</p>
<p>There is, where man finds not his happiness:</p>
<p>It is not true fruition, not that blest</p>
<p>Essence, of every good the branch and root.</p>
<p>The love too lavishly bestow'd on this,</p>
<p>Along three circles over us, is mourn'd.</p>
<p>Account of that division tripartite</p>
<p>Expect not, fitter for thine own research.</p>
</div>`,

`<p class="cantohead">CANTO XVIII</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>The teacher ended, and his high discourse</p>
<p>Concluding, earnest in my looks inquir'd</p>
<p>If I appear'd content; and I, whom still</p>
<p>Unsated thirst to hear him urg'd, was mute,</p>
<p>Mute outwardly, yet inwardly I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perchance my too much questioning offends</p>
<p>But he, true father, mark'd the secret wish</p>
<p>By diffidence restrain'd, and speaking, gave</p>
<p>Me boldness thus to speak: "Master, my Sight</p>
<p>Gathers so lively virtue from thy beams,</p>
<p>That all, thy words convey, distinct is seen.</p>
<p>Wherefore I pray thee, father, whom this heart</p>
<p>Holds dearest! thou wouldst deign by proof t' unfold</p>
<p>That love, from which as from their source thou bring'st</p>
<p>All good deeds and their opposite." He then:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To what I now disclose be thy clear ken</p>
<p>Directed, and thou plainly shalt behold</p>
<p>How much those blind have err'd, who make themselves</p>
<p>The guides of men. The soul, created apt</p>
<p>To love, moves versatile which way soe'er</p>
<p>Aught pleasing prompts her, soon as she is wak'd</p>
<p>By pleasure into act. Of substance true</p>
<p>Your apprehension forms its counterfeit,</p>
<p>And in you the ideal shape presenting</p>
<p>Attracts the soul's regard. If she, thus drawn,</p>
<p>incline toward it, love is that inclining,</p>
<p>And a new nature knit by pleasure in ye.</p>
<p>Then as the fire points up, and mounting seeks</p>
<p>His birth-place and his lasting seat, e'en thus</p>
<p>Enters the captive soul into desire,</p>
<p>Which is a spiritual motion, that ne'er rests</p>
<p>Before enjoyment of the thing it loves.</p>
<p>Enough to show thee, how the truth from those</p>
<p>Is hidden, who aver all love a thing</p>
<p>Praise-worthy in itself: although perhaps</p>
<p>Its substance seem still good. Yet if the wax</p>
<p>Be good, it follows not th' impression must.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What love is," I return'd, "thy words, O guide!</p>
<p>And my own docile mind, reveal. Yet thence</p>
<p>New doubts have sprung. For from without if love</p>
<p>Be offer'd to us, and the spirit knows</p>
<p>No other footing, tend she right or wrong,</p>
<p>Is no desert of hers." He answering thus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What reason here discovers I have power</p>
<p>To show thee: that which lies beyond, expect</p>
<p>From Beatrice, faith not reason's task.</p>
<p>Spirit, substantial form, with matter join'd</p>
<p>Not in confusion mix'd, hath in itself</p>
<p>Specific virtue of that union born,</p>
<p>Which is not felt except it work, nor prov'd</p>
<p>But through effect, as vegetable life</p>
<p>By the green leaf. From whence his intellect</p>
<p>Deduced its primal notices of things,</p>
<p>Man therefore knows not, or his appetites</p>
<p>Their first affections; such in you, as zeal</p>
<p>In bees to gather honey; at the first,</p>
<p>Volition, meriting nor blame nor praise.</p>
<p>But o'er each lower faculty supreme,</p>
<p>That as she list are summon'd to her bar,</p>
<p>Ye have that virtue in you, whose just voice</p>
<p>Uttereth counsel, and whose word should keep</p>
<p>The threshold of assent. Here is the source,</p>
<p>Whence cause of merit in you is deriv'd,</p>
<p>E'en as the affections good or ill she takes,</p>
<p>Or severs, winnow'd as the chaff. Those men</p>
<p>Who reas'ning went to depth profoundest, mark'd</p>
<p>That innate freedom, and were thence induc'd</p>
<p>To leave their moral teaching to the world.</p>
<p>Grant then, that from necessity arise</p>
<p>All love that glows within you; to dismiss</p>
<p>Or harbour it, the pow'r is in yourselves.</p>
<p>Remember, Beatrice, in her style,</p>
<p>Denominates free choice by eminence</p>
<p>The noble virtue, if in talk with thee</p>
<p>She touch upon that theme." The moon, well nigh</p>
<p>To midnight hour belated, made the stars</p>
<p>Appear to wink and fade; and her broad disk</p>
<p>Seem'd like a crag on fire, as up the vault</p>
<p>That course she journey'd, which the sun then warms,</p>
<p>When they of Rome behold him at his set.</p>
<p>Betwixt Sardinia and the Corsic isle.</p>
<p>And now the weight, that hung upon my thought,</p>
<p>Was lighten'd by the aid of that clear spirit,</p>
<p>Who raiseth Andes above Mantua's name.</p>
<p>I therefore, when my questions had obtain'd</p>
<p>Solution plain and ample, stood as one</p>
<p>Musing in dreary slumber; but not long</p>
<p>Slumber'd; for suddenly a multitude,</p>
<p>The steep already turning, from behind,</p>
<p>Rush'd on. With fury and like random rout,</p>
<p>As echoing on their shores at midnight heard</p>
<p>Ismenus and Asopus, for his Thebes</p>
<p>If Bacchus' help were needed; so came these</p>
<p>Tumultuous, curving each his rapid step,</p>
<p>By eagerness impell'd of holy love.</p>
<p class="slindent">Soon they o'ertook us; with such swiftness mov'd</p>
<p>The mighty crowd. Two spirits at their head</p>
<p>Cried weeping; "Blessed Mary sought with haste</p>
<p>The hilly region. Caesar to subdue</p>
<p>Ilerda, darted in Marseilles his sting,</p>
<p>And flew to Spain.&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Oh tarry not: away;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The others shouted; "let not time be lost</p>
<p>Through slackness of affection. Hearty zeal</p>
<p>To serve reanimates celestial grace.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;O ye, in whom intenser fervency</p>
<p>Haply supplies, where lukewarm erst ye fail'd,</p>
<p>Slow or neglectful, to absolve your part</p>
<p>Of good and virtuous, this man, who yet lives,</p>
<p>(Credit my tale, though strange) desires t' ascend,</p>
<p>So morning rise to light us. Therefore say</p>
<p>Which hand leads nearest to the rifted rock?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">So spake my guide, to whom a shade return'd:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come after us, and thou shalt find the cleft.</p>
<p>We may not linger: such resistless will</p>
<p>Speeds our unwearied course. Vouchsafe us then</p>
<p>Thy pardon, if our duty seem to thee</p>
<p>Discourteous rudeness. In Verona I</p>
<p>Was abbot of San Zeno, when the hand</p>
<p>Of Barbarossa grasp'd Imperial sway,</p>
<p>That name, ne'er utter'd without tears in Milan.</p>
<p>And there is he, hath one foot in his grave,</p>
<p>Who for that monastery ere long shall weep,</p>
<p>Ruing his power misus'd: for that his son,</p>
<p>Of body ill compact, and worse in mind,</p>
<p>And born in evil, he hath set in place</p>
<p>Of its true pastor." Whether more he spake,</p>
<p>Or here was mute, I know not: he had sped</p>
<p>E'en now so far beyond us. Yet thus much</p>
<p>I heard, and in rememb'rance treasur'd it.</p>
<p class="slindent">He then, who never fail'd me at my need,</p>
<p>Cried, "Hither turn. Lo! two with sharp remorse</p>
<p>Chiding their sin!" In rear of all the troop</p>
<p>These shouted: "First they died, to whom the sea</p>
<p>Open'd, or ever Jordan saw his heirs:</p>
<p>And they, who with Aeneas to the end</p>
<p>Endur'd not suffering, for their portion chose</p>
<p>Life without glory." Soon as they had fled</p>
<p>Past reach of sight, new thought within me rose</p>
<p>By others follow'd fast, and each unlike</p>
<p>Its fellow: till led on from thought to thought,</p>
<p>And pleasur'd with the fleeting train, mine eye</p>
<p>Was clos'd, and meditation chang'd to dream.</p>
</div>`,

`<p class="cantohead">CANTO XIX</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>It was the hour, when of diurnal heat</p>
<p>No reliques chafe the cold beams of the moon,</p>
<p>O'erpower'd by earth, or planetary sway</p>
<p>Of Saturn; and the geomancer sees</p>
<p>His Greater Fortune up the east ascend,</p>
<p>Where gray dawn checkers first the shadowy cone;</p>
<p>When 'fore me in my dream a woman's shape</p>
<p>There came, with lips that stammer'd, eyes aslant,</p>
<p>Distorted feet, hands maim'd, and colour pale.</p>
<p class="slindent">I look'd upon her; and as sunshine cheers</p>
<p>Limbs numb'd by nightly cold, e'en thus my look</p>
<p>Unloos'd her tongue, next in brief space her form</p>
<p>Decrepit rais'd erect, and faded face</p>
<p>With love's own hue illum'd. Recov'ring speech</p>
<p>She forthwith warbling such a strain began,</p>
<p>That I, how loth soe'er, could scarce have held</p>
<p>Attention from the song. "I," thus she sang,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the Siren, she, whom mariners</p>
<p>On the wide sea are wilder'd when they hear:</p>
<p>Such fulness of delight the list'ner feels.</p>
<p>I from his course Ulysses by my lay</p>
<p>Enchanted drew. Whoe'er frequents me once</p>
<p>Parts seldom; so I charm him, and his heart</p>
<p>Contented knows no void." Or ere her mouth</p>
<p>Was clos'd, to shame her at her side appear'd</p>
<p>A dame of semblance holy. With stern voice</p>
<p>She utter'd; "Say, O Virgil, who is this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which hearing, he approach'd, with eyes still bent</p>
<p>Toward that goodly presence: th' other seiz'd her,</p>
<p>And, her robes tearing, open'd her before,</p>
<p>And show'd the belly to me, whence a smell,</p>
<p>Exhaling loathsome, wak'd me. Round I turn'd</p>
<p>Mine eyes, and thus the teacher: "At the least</p>
<p>Three times my voice hath call'd thee. Rise, begone.</p>
<p>Let us the opening find where thou mayst pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">I straightway rose. Now day, pour'd down from high,</p>
<p>Fill'd all the circuits of the sacred mount;</p>
<p>And, as we journey'd, on our shoulder smote</p>
<p>The early ray. I follow'd, stooping low</p>
<p>My forehead, as a man, o'ercharg'd with thought,</p>
<p>Who bends him to the likeness of an arch,</p>
<p>That midway spans the flood; when thus I heard,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, enter here," in tone so soft and mild,</p>
<p>As never met the ear on mortal strand.</p>
<p class="slindent">With swan-like wings dispread and pointing up,</p>
<p>Who thus had spoken marshal'd us along,</p>
<p>Where each side of the solid masonry</p>
<p>The sloping, walls retir'd; then mov'd his plumes,</p>
<p>And fanning us, affirm'd that those, who mourn,</p>
<p>Are blessed, for that comfort shall be theirs.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;What aileth thee, that still thou look'st to earth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Began my leader; while th' angelic shape</p>
<p>A little over us his station took.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;New vision," I replied, "hath rais'd in me</p>
<p>8urmisings strange and anxious doubts, whereon</p>
<p>My soul intent allows no other thought</p>
<p>Or room or entrance.&mdash;&ldquo;Hast thou seen," said he,</p>
<p>&ldquo;That old enchantress, her, whose wiles alone</p>

<p>How man may free him of her bonds? Enough.</p>
<p>Let thy heels spurn the earth, and thy rais'd ken</p>
<p>Fix on the lure, which heav'n's eternal King</p>
<p>Whirls in the rolling spheres." As on his feet</p>
<p>The falcon first looks down, then to the sky</p>
<p>Turns, and forth stretches eager for the food,</p>
<p>That woos him thither; so the call I heard,</p>
<p>So onward, far as the dividing rock</p>
<p>Gave way, I journey'd, till the plain was reach'd.</p>
<p class="slindent">On the fifth circle when I stood at large,</p>
<p>A race appear'd before me, on the ground</p>
<p>All downward lying prone and weeping sore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My soul hath cleaved to the dust," I heard</p>
<p>With sighs so deep, they well nigh choak'd the words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O ye elect of God, whose penal woes</p>
<p>Both hope and justice mitigate, direct</p>
<p>Tow'rds the steep rising our uncertain way.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;If ye approach secure from this our doom,</p>
<p>Prostration&mdash;and would urge your course with speed,</p>
<p>See that ye still to rightward keep the brink.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">So them the bard besought; and such the words,</p>
<p>Beyond us some short space, in answer came.</p>
<p class="slindent">I noted what remain'd yet hidden from them:</p>
<p>Thence to my liege's eyes mine eyes I bent,</p>
<p>And he, forthwith interpreting their suit,</p>
<p>Beckon'd his glad assent. Free then to act,</p>
<p>As pleas'd me, I drew near, and took my stand</p>
<p>O&rsquo;er that shade, whose words I late had mark'd.</p>
<p>And, "Spirit!" I said, "in whom repentant tears</p>
<p>Mature that blessed hour, when thou with God</p>
<p>Shalt find acceptance, for a while suspend</p>
<p>For me that mightier care. Say who thou wast,</p>
<p>Why thus ye grovel on your bellies prone,</p>
<p>And if in aught ye wish my service there,</p>
<p>Whence living I am come." He answering spake</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cause why Heav'n our back toward his cope</p>
<p>Reverses, shalt thou know: but me know first</p>
<p>The successor of Peter, and the name</p>
<p>And title of my lineage from that stream,</p>
<p>That' twixt Chiaveri and Siestri draws</p>
<p>His limpid waters through the lowly glen.</p>
<p>A month and little more by proof I learnt,</p>
<p>With what a weight that robe of sov'reignty</p>
<p>Upon his shoulder rests, who from the mire</p>
<p>Would guard it: that each other fardel seems</p>
<p>But feathers in the balance. Late, alas!</p>
<p>Was my conversion: but when I became</p>
<p>Rome's pastor, I discern'd at once the dream</p>
<p>And cozenage of life, saw that the heart</p>
<p>Rested not there, and yet no prouder height</p>
<p>Lur'd on the climber: wherefore, of that life</p>
<p>No more enamour'd, in my bosom love</p>
<p>Of purer being kindled. For till then</p>
<p>I was a soul in misery, alienate</p>
<p>From God, and covetous of all earthly things;</p>
<p>Now, as thou seest, here punish'd for my doting.</p>
<p>Such cleansing from the taint of avarice</p>
<p>Do spirits converted need. This mount inflicts</p>
<p>No direr penalty. E'en as our eyes</p>
<p>Fasten'd below, nor e'er to loftier clime</p>
<p>Were lifted, thus hath justice level'd us</p>
<p>Here on the earth. As avarice quench'd our love</p>
<p>Of good, without which is no working, thus</p>
<p>Here justice holds us prison'd, hand and foot</p>
<p>Chain'd down and bound, while heaven's just Lord shall please.</p>
<p>So long to tarry motionless outstretch'd.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">My knees I stoop'd, and would have spoke; but he,</p>
<p>Ere my beginning, by his ear perceiv'd</p>
<p>I did him reverence; and "What cause," said he,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hath bow'd thee thus!&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;Compunction," I rejoin'd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And inward awe of your high dignity.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Up," he exclaim'd, "brother! upon thy feet</p>
<p>Arise: err not: thy fellow servant I,</p>
<p>(Thine and all others') of one Sovran Power.</p>
<p>If thou hast ever mark'd those holy sounds</p>
<p>Of gospel truth, 'nor shall be given ill marriage,'</p>
<p>Thou mayst discern the reasons of my speech.</p>
<p>Go thy ways now; and linger here no more.</p>
<p>Thy tarrying is a let unto the tears,</p>
<p>With which I hasten that whereof thou spak'st.</p>
<p>I have on earth a kinswoman; her name</p>
<p>Alagia, worthy in herself, so ill</p>

<p>I found the reins of empire, and such powers</p>
<p>Of new acquirement, with full store of friends,</p>
<p>That soon the widow'd circlet of the crown</p>
<p>Was girt upon the temples of my son,</p>
<p>He, from whose bones th' anointed race begins.</p>
<p>Till the great dower of Provence had remov'd</p>
<p>The stains, that yet obscur'd our lowly blood,</p>
<p>Its sway indeed was narrow, but howe'er</p>
<p>It wrought no evil: there, with force and lies,</p>
<p>Began its rapine; after, for amends,</p>
<p>Poitou it seiz'd, Navarre and Gascony.</p>
<p>To Italy came Charles, and for amends</p>
<p>Young Conradine an innocent victim slew,</p>
<p>And sent th' angelic teacher back to heav'n,</p>
<p>Still for amends. I see the time at hand,</p>
<p>That forth from France invites another Charles</p>

<p>Unarm'd he issues, saving with that lance,</p>
<p>Which the arch-traitor tilted with; and that</p>

<p>Seiz'd on me, as on one to death convey'd.</p>
<p>So shook not Delos, when Latona there</p>
<p>Couch'd to bring forth the twin-born eyes of heaven.</p>
<p class="slindent">Forthwith from every side a shout arose</p>
<p>So vehement, that suddenly my guide</p>

<p>Was ended: then our hallow'd path resum'd,</p>
<p>Eying the prostrate shadows, who renew'd</p>
<p>Their custom'd mourning. Never in my breast</p>

<p>We were not ware of it; so first it spake,</p>
<p>Saying, "God give you peace, my brethren!" then</p>
<p>Sudden we turn'd: and Virgil such salute,</p>

<p class="slindent">That questioning so tallied with my wish,</p>

<p>E'en from expectance. He forthwith replied,</p>
<p>&ldquo;In its devotion nought irregular</p>
<p>This mount can witness, or by punctual rule</p>
<p>Unsanction'd; here from every change exempt.</p>
<p>Other than that, which heaven in itself</p>

<p>Can reach us. Tempest none, shower, hail or snow,</p>

<p>With various motion rock'd, trembles the soil:</p>
<p>But here, through wind in earth's deep hollow pent,</p>
<p>I know not how, yet never trembled: then</p>
<p>Trembles, when any spirit feels itself</p>
<p>So purified, that it may rise, or move</p>
<p>For rising, and such loud acclaim ensues.</p>
<p>Purification by the will alone</p>
<p>Is prov'd, that free to change society</p>
<p>Seizes the soul rejoicing in her will.</p>
<p>Desire of bliss is present from the first;</p>
<p>But strong propension hinders, to that wish</p>
<p>By the just ordinance of heav'n oppos'd;</p>
<p>Propension now as eager to fulfil</p>
<p>Th' allotted torment, as erewhile to sin.</p>

<p>Five hundred years and more, but now have felt</p>
<p>Free wish for happier clime. Therefore thou felt'st</p>
<p>The mountain tremble, and the spirits devout</p>
<p>Heard'st, over all his limits, utter praise</p>
<p>To that liege Lord, whom I entreat their joy</p>
<p>To hasten." Thus he spake: and since the draught</p>
<p>Is grateful ever as the thirst is keen,</p>
<p>No words may speak my fullness of content.</p>

<p>From the bright fountain of celestial fire</p>

<p>Which sounds Aeneas' wand'rings: that the breast</p>

<p>Enjoin'd me silence but the power which wills,</p>
<p>Bears not supreme control: laughter and tears</p>
<p>Follow so closely on the passion prompts them,</p>
<p>They wait not for the motions of the will</p>
<p>In natures most sincere. I did but smile,</p>
<p>As one who winks; and thereupon the shade</p>
<p>Broke off, and peer'd into mine eyes, where best</p>
<p>Our looks interpret. "So to good event</p>
<p>Mayst thou conduct such great emprize," he cried,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, why across thy visage beam'd, but now,</p>
<p>The lightning of a smile!" On either part</p>
<p>Now am I straiten'd; one conjures me speak,</p>
<p>Th' other to silence binds me: whence a sigh</p>
<p>I utter, and the sigh is heard. "Speak on; &rdquo;</p>
<p>The teacher cried; "and do not fear to speak,</p>
<p>But tell him what so earnestly he asks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereon I thus: "Perchance, O ancient spirit!</p>
<p>Thou marvel'st at my smiling. There is room</p>
<p>For yet more wonder. He who guides my ken</p>
<p>On high, he is that Mantuan, led by whom</p>
<p>Thou didst presume of men arid gods to sing.</p>
<p>If other cause thou deem'dst for which I smil'd,</p>
<p>Leave it as not the true one; and believe</p>
<p>Those words, thou spak'st of him, indeed the cause.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Now down he bent t' embrace my teacher's feet;</p>
<p>But he forbade him: "Brother! do it not:</p>
<p>Thou art a shadow, and behold'st a shade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rising answer'd thus: "Now hast thou prov'd</p>

<p>Poet and Christian both to thee I owed.</p>
<p>That thou mayst mark more clearly what I trace,</p>
<p>My hand shall stretch forth to inform the lines</p>
<p>With livelier colouring. Soon o'er all the world,</p>
<p>By messengers from heav'n, the true belief</p>
<p>Teem'd now prolific, and that word of thine</p>
<p>Accordant, to the new instructors chim'd.</p>
<p>Induc'd by which agreement, I was wont</p>
<p>Resort to them; and soon their sanctity</p>
<p>So won upon me, that, Domitian's rage</p>
<p>Pursuing them, I mix'd my tears with theirs,</p>
<p>And, while on earth I stay'd, still succour'd them;</p>
<p>And their most righteous customs made me scorn</p>
<p>All sects besides. Before I led the Greeks</p>
<p>In tuneful fiction, to the streams of Thebes,</p>
<p>I was baptiz'd; but secretly, through fear,</p>
<p>Remain'd a Christian, and conform'd long time</p>
<p>To Pagan rites. Five centuries and more,</p>
<p>T for that lukewarmness was fain to pace</p>
<p>Round the fourth circle. Thou then, who hast rais'd</p>
<p>The covering, which did hide such blessing from me,</p>
<p>Whilst much of this ascent is yet to climb,</p>
<p>Say, if thou know, where our old Terence bides,</p>
<p>Caecilius, Plautus, Varro: if condemn'd</p>
<p>They dwell, and in what province of the deep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These," said my guide, "with Persius and myself,</p>
<p>And others many more, are with that Greek,</p>
<p>Of mortals, the most cherish'd by the Nine,</p>
<p>In the first ward of darkness. There ofttimes</p>
<p>We of that mount hold converse, on whose top</p>
<p>For aye our nurses live. We have the bard</p>
<p>Of Pella, and the Teian, Agatho,</p>
<p>Simonides, and many a Grecian else</p>
<p>Ingarlanded with laurel. Of thy train</p>
<p>Antigone is there, Deiphile,</p>
<p>Argia, and as sorrowful as erst</p>
<p>Ismene, and who show'd Langia's wave:</p>
<p>Deidamia with her sisters there,</p>
<p>And blind Tiresias' daughter, and the bride</p>
<p>Sea-born of Peleus." Either poet now</p>
<p>Was silent, and no longer by th' ascent</p>
<p>Or the steep walls obstructed, round them cast</p>
<p>Inquiring eyes. Four handmaids of the day</p>
<p>Had finish'd now their office, and the fifth</p>
<p>Was at the chariot-beam, directing still</p>
<p>Its balmy point aloof, when thus my guide:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Methinks, it well behooves us to the brink</p>
<p>Bend the right shoulder' circuiting the mount,</p>
<p>As we have ever us'd." So custom there</p>
<p>Was usher to the road, the which we chose</p>
<p>Less doubtful, as that worthy shade complied.</p>
<p class="slindent">They on before me went; I sole pursued,</p>
<p>List'ning their speech, that to my thoughts convey'd</p>
<p>Mysterious lessons of sweet poesy.</p>
<p>But soon they ceas'd; for midway of the road</p>
<p>A tree we found, with goodly fruitage hung,</p>
<p>And pleasant to the smell: and as a fir</p>
<p>Upward from bough to bough less ample spreads,</p>
<p>So downward this less ample spread, that none.</p>
<p>Methinks, aloft may climb. Upon the side,</p>
<p>That clos'd our path, a liquid crystal fell</p>
<p>From the steep rock, and through the sprays above</p>
<p>Stream'd showering. With associate step the bards</p>
<p>Drew near the plant; and from amidst the leaves</p>
<p>A voice was heard: "Ye shall be chary of me;&rdquo;</p>
<p>And after added: "Mary took more thought</p>
<p>For joy and honour of the nuptial feast,</p>
<p>Than for herself who answers now for you.</p>
<p>The women of old Rome were satisfied</p>
<p>With water for their beverage. Daniel fed</p>
<p>On pulse, and wisdom gain'd. The primal age</p>
<p>Was beautiful as gold; and hunger then</p>
<p>Made acorns tasteful, thirst each rivulet</p>
<p>Run nectar. Honey and locusts were the food,</p>
<p>Whereon the Baptist in the wilderness</p>
<p>Fed, and that eminence of glory reach'd</p>
<p>And greatness, which the' Evangelist records.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>On the green leaf mine eyes were fix'd, like his</p>
<p>Who throws away his days in idle chase</p>
<p>Of the diminutive, when thus I heard</p>
<p>The more than father warn me: "Son! our time</p>
<p>Asks thriftier using. Linger not: away.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Thereat my face and steps at once I turn'd</p>
<p>Toward the sages, by whose converse cheer'd</p>
<p>I journey'd on, and felt no toil: and lo!</p>
<p>A sound of weeping and a song: "My lips,</p>
<p>O Lord!" and these so mingled, it gave birth</p>
<p>To pleasure and to pain. "O Sire, belov'd!</p>
<p>Say what is this I hear?" Thus I inquir'd.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Spirits," said he, "who as they go, perchance,</p>
<p>Their debt of duty pay." As on their road</p>
<p>The thoughtful pilgrims, overtaking some</p>
<p>Not known unto them, turn to them, and look,</p>
<p>But stay not; thus, approaching from behind</p>
<p>With speedier motion, eyed us, as they pass'd,</p>
<p>A crowd of spirits, silent and devout.</p>
<p>The eyes of each were dark and hollow: pale</p>
<p>Their visage, and so lean withal, the bones</p>
<p>Stood staring thro' the skin. I do not think</p>
<p>Thus dry and meagre Erisicthon show'd,</p>
<p>When pinc'ed by sharp-set famine to the quick.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Lo!" to myself I mus'd, "the race, who lost</p>
<p>Jerusalem, when Mary with dire beak</p>
<p>Prey'd on her child." The sockets seem'd as rings,</p>
<p>From which the gems were drops. Who reads the name</p>
<p>Of man upon his forehead, there the M</p>
<p>Had trac'd most plainly. Who would deem, that scent</p>
<p>Of water and an apple, could have prov'd</p>
<p>Powerful to generate such pining want,</p>
<p>Not knowing how it wrought? While now I stood</p>
<p>Wond'ring what thus could waste them (for the cause</p>
<p>Of their gaunt hollowness and scaly rind</p>
<p>Appear'd not) lo! a spirit turn'd his eyes</p>
<p>In their deep-sunken cell, and fasten'd then</p>
<p>On me, then cried with vehemence aloud:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What grace is this vouchsaf'd me?" By his looks</p>
<p>I ne'er had recogniz'd him: but the voice</p>
<p>Brought to my knowledge what his cheer conceal'd.</p>
<p>Remembrance of his alter'd lineaments</p>
<p>Was kindled from that spark; and I agniz'd</p>
<p>The visage of Forese. "Ah! respect</p>
<p>This wan and leprous wither'd skin," thus he</p>
<p>Suppliant implor'd, "this macerated flesh.</p>
<p>Speak to me truly of thyself. And who</p>
<p>Are those twain spirits, that escort thee there?</p>
<p>Be it not said thou Scorn'st to talk with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;That face of thine," I answer'd him, "which dead</p>
<p>I once bewail'd, disposes me not less</p>
<p>For weeping, when I see It thus transform'd.</p>
<p>Say then, by Heav'n, what blasts ye thus? The whilst</p>
<p>I wonder, ask not Speech from me: unapt</p>
<p>Is he to speak, whom other will employs.</p>
<p class="slindent">He thus: "The water and tee plant we pass'd,</p>
<p>Virtue possesses, by th' eternal will</p>
<p>Infus'd, the which so pines me. Every spirit,</p>
<p>Whose song bewails his gluttony indulg'd</p>
<p>Too grossly, here in hunger and in thirst</p>
<p>Is purified. The odour, which the fruit,</p>
<p>And spray, that showers upon the verdure, breathe,</p>
<p>Inflames us with desire to feed and drink.</p>
<p>Nor once alone encompassing our route</p>
<p>We come to add fresh fuel to the pain:</p>
<p>Pain, said I? solace rather: for that will</p>
<p>To the tree leads us, by which Christ was led</p>
<p>To call Elias, joyful when he paid</p>
<p>Our ransom from his vein." I answering thus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forese! from that day, in which the world</p>
<p>For better life thou changedst, not five years</p>
<p>Have circled. If the power of sinning more</p>
<p>Were first concluded in thee, ere thou knew'st</p>
<p>That kindly grief, which re-espouses us</p>
<p>To God, how hither art thou come so soon?</p>
<p>I thought to find thee lower, there, where time</p>
<p>Is recompense for time." He straight replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To drink up the sweet wormwood of affliction</p>
<p>I have been brought thus early by the tears</p>
<p>Stream'd down my Nella's cheeks. Her prayers devout,</p>
<p>Her sighs have drawn me from the coast, where oft</p>
<p>Expectance lingers, and have set me free</p>
<p>From th' other circles. In the sight of God</p>
<p>So much the dearer is my widow priz'd,</p>
<p>She whom I lov'd so fondly, as she ranks</p>
<p>More singly eminent for virtuous deeds.</p>
<p>The tract most barb'rous of Sardinia's isle,</p>
<p>Hath dames more chaste and modester by far</p>
<p>Than that wherein I left her. O sweet brother!</p>
<p>What wouldst thou have me say? A time to come</p>
<p>Stands full within my view, to which this hour</p>
<p>Shall not be counted of an ancient date,</p>
<p>When from the pulpit shall be loudly warn'd</p>
<p>Th' unblushing dames of Florence, lest they bare</p>
<p>Unkerchief'd bosoms to the common gaze.</p>
<p>What savage women hath the world e'er seen,</p>
<p>What Saracens, for whom there needed scourge</p>
<p>Of spiritual or other discipline,</p>
<p>To force them walk with cov'ring on their limbs!</p>
<p>But did they see, the shameless ones, that Heav'n</p>
<p>Wafts on swift wing toward them, while I speak,</p>
<p>Their mouths were op'd for howling: they shall taste</p>
<p>Of Borrow (unless foresight cheat me here)</p>
<p>Or ere the cheek of him be cloth'd with down</p>
<p>Who is now rock'd with lullaby asleep.</p>
<p>Ah! now, my brother, hide thyself no more,</p>
<p>Thou seest how not I alone but all</p>
<p>Gaze, where thou veil'st the intercepted sun.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Whence I replied: "If thou recall to mind</p>
<p>What we were once together, even yet</p>
<p>Remembrance of those days may grieve thee sore.</p>
<p>That I forsook that life, was due to him</p>
<p>Who there precedes me, some few evenings past,</p>
<p>When she was round, who shines with sister lamp</p>
<p>To his, that glisters yonder," and I show'd</p>
<p>The sun. "Tis he, who through profoundest night</p>
<p>Of he true dead has brought me, with this flesh</p>
<p>As true, that follows. From that gloom the aid</p>
<p>Of his sure comfort drew me on to climb,</p>
<p>And climbing wind along this mountain-steep,</p>
<p>Which rectifies in you whate'er the world</p>
<p>Made crooked and deprav'd I have his word,</p>
<p>That he will bear me company as far</p>
<p>As till I come where Beatrice dwells:</p>
<p>But there must leave me. Virgil is that spirit,</p>
<p>Who thus hath promis'd," and I pointed to him;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other is that shade, for whom so late</p>

`<p class="cantohead">CANTO XXIV</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>Our journey was not slacken'd by our talk,</p>
<p>Nor yet our talk by journeying. Still we spake,</p>
<p>And urg'd our travel stoutly, like a ship</p>
<p>When the wind sits astern. The shadowy forms,</p>
<p>That seem'd things dead and dead again, drew in</p>
<p>At their deep-delved orbs rare wonder of me,</p>
<p>Perceiving I had life; and I my words</p>
<p>Continued, and thus spake; "He journeys up</p>
<p>Perhaps more tardily then else he would,</p>

<p>Of Lucca: and that face beyond him, pierc'd</p>
<p>Unto a leaner fineness than the rest,</p>
<p>Had keeping of the church: he was of Tours,</p>
<p>And purges by wan abstinence away</p>
<p>Bolsena's eels and cups of muscadel.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">He show'd me many others, one by one,</p>
<p>And all, as they were nam'd, seem'd well content;</p>
<p>For no dark gesture I discern'd in any.</p>
<p>I saw through hunger Ubaldino grind</p>
<p>His teeth on emptiness; and Boniface,</p>
<p>That wav'd the crozier o'er a num'rous flock.</p>
<p>I saw the Marquis, who tad time erewhile</p>
<p>To swill at Forli with less drought, yet so</p>
<p>Was one ne'er sated. I howe'er, like him,</p>
<p>That gazing 'midst a crowd, singles out one,</p>
<p>So singled him of Lucca; for methought</p>
<p>Was none amongst them took such note of me.</p>
<p>Somewhat I heard him whisper of Gentucca:</p>
<p>The sound was indistinct, and murmur'd there,</p>
<p>Where justice, that so strips them, fix'd her sting.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Spirit!" said I, "it seems as thou wouldst fain</p>
<p>Speak with me. Let me hear thee. Mutual wish</p>
<p>To converse prompts, which let us both indulge.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">He, answ'ring, straight began: "Woman is born,</p>
<p>Whose brow no wimple shades yet, that shall make</p>
<p>My city please thee, blame it as they may.</p>
<p>Go then with this forewarning. If aught false</p>
<p>My whisper too implied, th' event shall tell</p>
<p>But say, if of a truth I see the man</p>
<p>Of that new lay th' inventor, which begins</p>
<p>With 'Ladies, ye that con the lore of love'.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">To whom I thus: "Count of me but as one</p>
<p>Who am the scribe of love; that, when he breathes,</p>
<p>Take up my pen, and, as he dictates, write.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Brother!" said he, "the hind'rance which once held</p>
<p>The notary with Guittone and myself,</p>
<p>Short of that new and sweeter style I hear,</p>
<p>Is now disclos'd. I see how ye your plumes</p>
<p>Stretch, as th' inditer guides them; which, no question,</p>
<p>Ours did not. He that seeks a grace beyond,</p>
<p>Sees not the distance parts one style from other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, as contented, here he held his peace.</p>
<p class="slindent">Like as the bird, that winter near the Nile,</p>
<p>In squared regiment direct their course,</p>
<p>Then stretch themselves in file for speedier flight;</p>
<p>Thus all the tribe of spirits, as they turn'd</p>
<p>Their visage, faster deaf, nimble alike</p>
<p>Through leanness and desire. And as a man,</p>
<p>Tir'd With the motion of a trotting steed,</p>
<p>Slacks pace, and stays behind his company,</p>
<p>Till his o'erbreathed lungs keep temperate time;</p>
<p>E'en so Forese let that holy crew</p>
<p>Proceed, behind them lingering at my side,</p>
<p>And saying: "When shall I again behold thee?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;How long my life may last," said I, "I know not;</p>
<p>This know, how soon soever I return,</p>
<p>My wishes will before me have arriv'd.</p>
<p>Sithence the place, where I am set to live,</p>
<p>Is, day by day, more scoop'd of all its good,</p>
<p>And dismal ruin seems to threaten it.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Go now," he cried: "lo! he, whose guilt is most,</p>
<p>Passes before my vision, dragg'd at heels</p>
<p>Of an infuriate beast. Toward the vale,</p>
<p>Where guilt hath no redemption, on it speeds,</p>
<p>Each step increasing swiftness on the last;</p>
<p>Until a blow it strikes, that leaveth him</p>
<p>A corse most vilely shatter'd. No long space</p>
<p>Those wheels have yet to roll" (therewith his eyes</p>
<p>Look'd up to heav'n) "ere thou shalt plainly see</p>
<p>That which my words may not more plainly tell.</p>
<p>I quit thee: time is precious here: I lose</p>
<p>Too much, thus measuring my pace with shine.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">As from a troop of well-rank'd chivalry</p>
<p>One knight, more enterprising than the rest,</p>
<p>Pricks forth at gallop, eager to display</p>
<p>His prowess in the first encounter prov'd</p>
<p>So parted he from us with lengthen'd strides,</p>
<p>And left me on the way with those twain spirits,</p>
<p>Who were such mighty marshals of the world.</p>
<p class="slindent">When he beyond us had so fled mine eyes</p>
<p>No nearer reach'd him, than my thought his words,</p>
<p>The branches of another fruit, thick hung,</p>
<p>And blooming fresh, appear'd. E'en as our steps</p>
<p>Turn'd thither, not far off it rose to view.</p>
<p>Beneath it were a multitude, that rais'd</p>
<p>Their hands, and shouted forth I know not What</p>
<p>Unto the boughs; like greedy and fond brats,</p>
<p>That beg, and answer none obtain from him,</p>
<p>Of whom they beg; but more to draw them on,</p>
<p>He at arm's length the object of their wish</p>
<p>Above them holds aloft, and hides it not.</p>
<p class="slindent">At length, as undeceiv'd they went their way:</p>
<p>And we approach the tree, who vows and tears</p>
<p>Sue to in vain, the mighty tree. "Pass on,</p>
<p>And come not near. Stands higher up the wood,</p>
<p>Whereof Eve tasted, and from it was ta'en</p>
<p>'this plant." Such sounds from midst the thickets came.</p>
<p>Whence I, with either bard, close to the side</p>
<p>That rose, pass'd forth beyond. "Remember," next</p>
<p>We heard, "those noblest creatures of the clouds,</p>
<p>How they their twofold bosoms overgorg'd</p>
<p>Oppos'd in fight to Theseus: call to mind</p>
<p>The Hebrews, how effeminate they stoop'd</p>
<p>To ease their thirst; whence Gideon's ranks were thinn'd,</p>
<p>As he to Midian march'd adown the hills.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Thus near one border coasting, still we heard</p>
<p>The sins of gluttony, with woe erewhile</p>
<p>Reguerdon'd. Then along the lonely path,</p>
<p>Once more at large, full thousand paces on</p>
<p>We travel'd, each contemplative and mute.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Why pensive journey thus ye three alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus suddenly a voice exclaim'd: whereat</p>
<p>I shook, as doth a scar'd and paltry beast;</p>
<p>Then rais'd my head to look from whence it came.</p>
<p class="slindent">Was ne'er, in furnace, glass, or metal seen</p>
<p>So bright and glowing red, as was the shape</p>
<p>I now beheld. "If ye desire to mount,&rdquo;</p>
<p>He cried, "here must ye turn. This way he goes,</p>
<p>Who goes in quest of peace." His countenance</p>
<p>Had dazzled me; and to my guides I fac'd</p>
<p>Backward, like one who walks, as sound directs.</p>
<p class="slindent">As when, to harbinger the dawn, springs up</p>
<p>On freshen'd wing the air of May, and breathes</p>
<p>Of fragrance, all impregn'd with herb and flowers,</p>
<p>E'en such a wind I felt upon my front</p>
<p>Blow gently, and the moving of a wing</p>
<p>Perceiv'd, that moving shed ambrosial smell;</p>
<p>And then a voice: "Blessed are they, whom grace</p>
<p>Doth so illume, that appetite in them</p>
<p>Exhaleth no inordinate desire,</p>
<p>Still hung'ring as the rule of temperance wills.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>It was an hour, when he who climbs, had need</p>
<p>To walk uncrippled: for the sun had now</p>
<p>To Taurus the meridian circle left,</p>
<p>And to the Scorpion left the night. As one</p>
<p>That makes no pause, but presses on his road,</p>
<p>Whate'er betide him, if some urgent need</p>
<p>Impel: so enter'd we upon our way,</p>
<p>One before other; for, but singly, none</p>
<p>That steep and narrow scale admits to climb.</p>
<p class="slindent">E'en as the young stork lifteth up his wing</p>
<p>Through wish to fly, yet ventures not to quit</p>
<p>The nest, and drops it; so in me desire</p>
<p>Of questioning my guide arose, and fell,</p>
<p>Arriving even to the act, that marks</p>
<p>A man prepar'd for speech. Him all our haste</p>
<p>Restrain'd not, but thus spake the sire belov'd:</p>
<p>Fear not to speed the shaft, that on thy lip</p>
<p>Stands trembling for its flight." Encourag'd thus</p>
<p>I straight began: "How there can leanness come,</p>
<p>Where is no want of nourishment to feed?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;If thou," he answer'd, "hadst remember'd thee,</p>
<p>How Meleager with the wasting brand</p>
<p>Wasted alike, by equal fires consm'd,</p>
<p>This would not trouble thee: and hadst thou thought,</p>
<p>How in the mirror your reflected form</p>
<p>With mimic motion vibrates, what now seems</p>
<p>Hard, had appear'd no harder than the pulp</p>
<p>Of summer fruit mature. But that thy will</p>
<p>In certainty may find its full repose,</p>
<p>Lo Statius here! on him I call, and pray</p>
<p>That he would now be healer of thy wound.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;If in thy presence I unfold to him</p>
<p>The secrets of heaven's vengeance, let me plead</p>

<p>&ldquo;Attend my words, O son, and in thy mind</p>
<p>Receive them: so shall they be light to clear</p>
<p>The doubt thou offer'st. Blood, concocted well,</p>
<p>Which by the thirsty veins is ne'er imbib'd,</p>
<p>And rests as food superfluous, to be ta'en</p>
<p>From the replenish'd table, in the heart</p>
<p>Derives effectual virtue, that informs</p>
<p>The several human limbs, as being that,</p>
<p>Which passes through the veins itself to make them.</p>
<p>Yet more concocted it descends, where shame</p>
<p>Forbids to mention: and from thence distils</p>
<p>In natural vessel on another's blood.</p>
<p>Then each unite together, one dispos'd</p>
<p>T' endure, to act the other, through meet frame</p>
<p>Of its recipient mould: that being reach'd,</p>

<p>Then vivifies what its own substance caus'd</p>
<p>To bear. With animation now indued,</p>
<p>The active virtue (differing from a plant</p>
<p>No further, than that this is on the way</p>
<p>And at its limit that) continues yet</p>
<p>To operate, that now it moves, and feels,</p>
<p>As sea sponge clinging to the rock: and there</p>
<p>Assumes th' organic powers its seed convey'd.</p>
<p>'This is the period, son! at which the virtue,</p>

<p>How babe of animal becomes, remains</p>
<p>For thy consid'ring. At this point, more wise,</p>

<p>The primal Mover with a smile of joy</p>
<p>On such great work of nature, and imbreathes</p>
<p>New spirit replete with virtue, that what here</p>
<p>Active it finds, to its own substance draws,</p>
<p>And forms an individual soul, that lives,</p>
<p>And feels, and bends reflective on itself.</p>
<p>And that thou less mayst marvel at the word,</p>
<p>Mark the sun's heat, how that to wine doth change,</p>
<p>Mix'd with the moisture filter'd through the vine.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;When Lachesis hath spun the thread, the soul</p>
<p>Takes with her both the human and divine,</p>
<p>Memory, intelligence, and will, in act</p>
<p>Far keener than before, the other powers</p>
<p>Inactive all and mute. No pause allow'd,</p>
<p>In wond'rous sort self-moving, to one strand</p>
<p>Of those, where the departed roam, she falls,</p>
<p>Here learns her destin'd path. Soon as the place</p>
<p>Receives her, round the plastic virtue beams,</p>
<p>Distinct as in the living limbs before:</p>
<p>And as the air, when saturate with showers,</p>
<p>The casual beam refracting, decks itself</p>
<p>With many a hue; so here the ambient air</p>
<p>Weareth that form, which influence of the soul</p>
<p>Imprints on it; and like the flame, that where</p>
<p>The fire moves, thither follows, so henceforth</p>
<p>The new form on the spirit follows still:</p>
<p>Hence hath it semblance, and is shadow call'd,</p>
<p>With each sense even to the sight endued:</p>
<p>Hence speech is ours, hence laughter, tears, and sighs</p>
<p>Which thou mayst oft have witness'd on the mount</p>
<p>Th' obedient shadow fails not to present</p>
<p>Whatever varying passion moves within us.</p>
<p>And this the cause of what thou marvel'st at.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Now the last flexure of our way we reach'd,</p>
<p>And to the right hand turning, other care</p>
<p>Awaits us. Here the rocky precipice</p>
<p>Hurls forth redundant flames, and from the rim</p>
<p>A blast upblown, with forcible rebuff</p>
<p>Driveth them back, sequester'd from its bound.</p>
<p class="slindent">Behoov'd us, one by one, along the side,</p>
<p>That border'd on the void, to pass; and I</p>
<p>Fear'd on one hand the fire, on th' other fear'd</p>
<p>Headlong to fall: when thus th' instructor warn'd:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strict rein must in this place direct the eyes.</p>
<p>A little swerving and the way is lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Then from the bosom of the burning mass,</p>
<p>&ldquo;O God of mercy!" heard I sung; and felt</p>
<p>No less desire to turn. And when I saw</p>
<p>Spirits along the flame proceeding, I</p>
<p>Between their footsteps and mine own was fain</p>
<p>To share by turns my view. At the hymn's close</p>
<p>They shouted loud, "I do not know a man;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then in low voice again took up the strain,</p>
<p>Which once more ended, "To the wood," they cried,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ran Dian, and drave forth Callisto, stung</p>
<p>With Cytherea's poison:" then return'd</p>
<p>Unto their song; then marry a pair extoll'd,</p>
<p>Who liv'd in virtue chastely, and the bands</p>
<p>Of wedded love. Nor from that task, I ween,</p>
<p>Surcease they; whilesoe'er the scorching fire</p>
<p>Enclasps them. Of such skill appliance needs</p>
<p>To medicine the wound, that healeth last.</p>

`<p class="cantohead">CANTO XXVI</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>>While singly thus along the rim we walk'd,</p>
<p>Oft the good master warn'd me: "Look thou well.</p>
<p>Avail it that I caution thee." The sun</p>
<p>Now all the western clime irradiate chang'd</p>
<p>From azure tinct to white; and, as I pass'd,</p>
<p>My passing shadow made the umber'd flame</p>
<p>Burn ruddier. At so strange a sight I mark'd</p>
<p>That many a spirit marvel'd on his way.</p>
<p class="slindent">This bred occasion first to speak of me,</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seems," said they, "no insubstantial frame:&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then to obtain what certainty they might,</p>
<p>Stretch'd towards me, careful not to overpass</p>
<p>The burning pale. "O thou, who followest</p>
<p>The others, haply not more slow than they,</p>
<p>But mov'd by rev'rence, answer me, who burn</p>
<p>In thirst and fire: nor I alone, but these</p>
<p>All for thine answer do more thirst, than doth</p>
<p>Indian or Aethiop for the cooling stream.</p>
<p>Tell us, how is it that thou mak'st thyself</p>
<p>A wall against the sun, as thou not yet</p>
<p>Into th' inextricable toils of death</p>
<p>Hadst enter'd?" Thus spake one, and I had straight</p>
<p>Declar'd me, if attention had not turn'd</p>
<p>To new appearance. Meeting these, there came,</p>
<p>Midway the burning path, a crowd, on whom</p>
<p>Earnestly gazing, from each part I view</p>
<p>The shadows all press forward, sev'rally</p>
<p>Each snatch a hasty kiss, and then away.</p>
<p>E'en so the emmets, 'mid their dusky troops,</p>
<p>Peer closely one at other, to spy out</p>
<p>Their mutual road perchance, and how they thrive.</p>
<p class="slindent">That friendly greeting parted, ere dispatch</p>
<p>Of the first onward step, from either tribe</p>
<p>Loud clamour rises: those, who newly come,</p>
<p>Shout Sodom and Gomorrah!" these, "The cow</p>
<p>Pasiphae enter'd, that the beast she woo'd</p>
<p>Might rush unto her luxury." Then as cranes,</p>
<p>That part towards the Riphaean mountains fly,</p>
<p>Part towards the Lybic sands, these to avoid</p>
<p>The ice, and those the sun; so hasteth off</p>
<p>One crowd, advances th' other; and resume</p>
<p>Their first song weeping, and their several shout.</p>
<p class="slindent">Again drew near my side the very same,</p>
<p>Who had erewhile besought me, and their looks</p>
<p>Mark'd eagerness to listen. I, who twice</p>
<p>Their will had noted, spake: "O spirits secure,</p>
<p>Whene'er the time may be, of peaceful end!</p>
<p>My limbs, nor crude, nor in mature old age,</p>
<p>Have I left yonder: here they bear me, fed</p>
<p>With blood, and sinew-strung. That I no more</p>
<p>May live in blindness, hence I tend aloft.</p>
<p>There is a dame on high, who wind for us</p>
<p>This grace, by which my mortal through your realm</p>
<p>I bear. But may your utmost wish soon meet</p>
<p>Such full fruition, that the orb of heaven,</p>
<p>Fullest of love, and of most ample space,</p>
<p>Receive you, as ye tell (upon my page</p>
<p>Henceforth to stand recorded) who ye are,</p>
<p>And what this multitude, that at your backs</p>
<p>Have past behind us." As one, mountain-bred,</p>
<p>Rugged and clownish, if some city's walls</p>
<p>He chance to enter, round him stares agape,</p>
<p>Confounded and struck dumb; e'en such appear'd</p>
<p>Each spirit. But when rid of that amaze,</p>
<p>(Not long the inmate of a noble heart)</p>
<p>He, who before had question'd, thus resum'd:</p>
<p>&ldquo;O blessed, who, for death preparing, tak'st</p>
<p>Experience of our limits, in thy bark!</p>
<p>Their crime, who not with us proceed, was that,</p>
<p>For which, as he did triumph, Caesar heard</p>
<p>The snout of 'queen,' to taunt him. Hence their cry</p>
<p>Of 'Sodom,' as they parted, to rebuke</p>
<p>Themselves, and aid the burning by their shame.</p>
<p>Our sinning was Hermaphrodite: but we,</p>
<p>Because the law of human kind we broke,</p>
<p>Following like beasts our vile concupiscence,</p>
<p>Hence parting from them, to our own disgrace</p>
<p>Record the name of her, by whom the beast</p>
<p>In bestial tire was acted. Now our deeds</p>
<p>Thou know'st, and how we sinn'd. If thou by name</p>
<p>Wouldst haply know us, time permits not now</p>
<p>To tell so much, nor can I. Of myself</p>
<p>Learn what thou wishest. Guinicelli I,</p>
<p>Who having truly sorrow'd ere my last,</p>
<p>Already cleanse me." With such pious joy,</p>
<p>As the two sons upon their mother gaz'd</p>
<p>From sad Lycurgus rescu'd, such my joy</p>
<p>(Save that I more represt it) when I heard</p>
<p>From his own lips the name of him pronounc'd,</p>
<p>Who was a father to me, and to those</p>
<p>My betters, who have ever us'd the sweet</p>
<p>And pleasant rhymes of love. So nought I heard</p>
<p>Nor spake, but long time thoughtfully I went,</p>
<p>Gazing on him; and, only for the fire,</p>
<p>Approach'd not nearer. When my eyes were fed</p>
<p>By looking on him, with such solemn pledge,</p>
<p>As forces credence, I devoted me</p>
<p>Unto his service wholly. In reply</p>
<p>He thus bespake me: "What from thee I hear</p>
<p>Is grav'd so deeply on my mind, the waves</p>
<p>Of Lethe shall not wash it off, nor make</p>
<p>A whit less lively. But as now thy oath</p>
<p>Has seal'd the truth, declare what cause impels</p>
<p>That love, which both thy looks and speech bewray.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Those dulcet lays," I answer'd, "which, as long</p>
<p>As of our tongue the beauty does not fade,</p>
<p>Shall make us love the very ink that trac'd them.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Brother!" he cried, and pointed at a shade</p>
<p>Before him, "there is one, whose mother speech</p>
<p>Doth owe to him a fairer ornament.</p>
<p>He in love ditties and the tales of prose</p>
<p>Without a rival stands, and lets the fools</p>
<p>Talk on, who think the songster of Limoges</p>
<p>O'ertops him. Rumour and the popular voice</p>
<p>They look to more than truth, and so confirm</p>
<p>Opinion, ere by art or reason taught.</p>
<p>Thus many of the elder time cried up</p>
<p>Guittone, giving him the prize, till truth</p>
<p>By strength of numbers vanquish'd. If thou own</p>
<p>So ample privilege, as to have gain'd</p>
<p>Free entrance to the cloister, whereof Christ</p>
<p>Is Abbot of the college, say to him</p>
<p>One paternoster for me, far as needs</p>
<p>For dwellers in this world, where power to sin</p>
<p>No longer tempts us." Haply to make way</p>
<p>For one, that follow'd next, when that was said,</p>
<p>He vanish'd through the fire, as through the wave</p>
<p>A fish, that glances diving to the deep.</p>
<p class="slindent">I, to the spirit he had shown me, drew</p>
<p>A little onward, and besought his name,</p>
<p>For which my heart, I said, kept gracious room.</p>
<p>He frankly thus began: "Thy courtesy</p>
<p>So wins on me, I have nor power nor will</p>
<p>To hide me. I am Arnault; and with songs,</p>
<p>Sorely lamenting for my folly past,</p>
<p>Thorough this ford of fire I wade, and see</p>
<p>The day, I hope for, smiling in my view.</p>
<p>I pray ye by the worth that guides ye up</p>
<p>Unto the summit of the scale, in time</p>
<p>Remember ye my suff'rings." With such words</p>
<p>He disappear'd in the refining flame.</p>
</div>`,

`<p class="cantohead">CANTO XXVII</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>Now was the sun so station'd, as when first</p>
<p>His early radiance quivers on the heights,</p>
<p>Where stream'd his Maker's blood, while Libra hangs</p>
<p>Above Hesperian Ebro, and new fires</p>
<p>Meridian flash on Ganges' yellow tide.</p>
<p class="slindent">So day was sinking, when the' angel of God</p>
<p>Appear'd before us. Joy was in his mien.</p>
<p>Forth of the flame he stood upon the brink,</p>
<p>And with a voice, whose lively clearness far</p>
<p>Surpass'd our human, "Blessed are the pure</p>
<p>In heart," he Sang: then near him as we came,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ye not further, holy spirits!" he cried,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ere the fire pierce you: enter in; and list</p>
<p>Attentive to the song ye hear from thence.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">I, when I heard his saying, was as one</p>
<p>Laid in the grave. My hands together clasp'd,</p>
<p>And upward stretching, on the fire I look'd,</p>
<p>And busy fancy conjur'd up the forms</p>
<p>Erewhile beheld alive consum'd in flames.</p>
<p class="slindent">Th' escorting spirits turn'd with gentle looks</p>
<p>Toward me, and the Mantuan spake: "My son,</p>
<p>Here torment thou mayst feel, but canst not death.</p>
<p>Remember thee, remember thee, if I</p>
<p>Safe e'en on Geryon brought thee: now I come</p>
<p>More near to God, wilt thou not trust me now?</p>
<p>Of this be sure: though in its womb that flame</p>
<p>A thousand years contain'd thee, from thy head</p>
<p>No hair should perish. If thou doubt my truth,</p>
<p>Approach, and with thy hands thy vesture's hem</p>
<p>Stretch forth, and for thyself confirm belief.</p>
<p>Lay now all fear, O lay all fear aside.</p>
<p>Turn hither, and come onward undismay'd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I still, though conscience urg'd' no step advanc'd.</p>
<p class="slindent">When still he saw me fix'd and obstinate,</p>
<p>Somewhat disturb'd he cried: "Mark now, my son,</p>
<p>From Beatrice thou art by this wall</p>
<p>Divided." As at Thisbe's name the eye</p>
<p>Of Pyramus was open'd (when life ebb'd</p>
<p>Fast from his veins), and took one parting glance,</p>
<p>While vermeil dyed the mulberry; thus I turn'd</p>
<p>To my sage guide, relenting, when I heard</p>
<p>The name, that springs forever in my breast.</p>
<p class="slindent">He shook his forehead; and, "How long," he said,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Linger we now?" then smil'd, as one would smile</p>
<p>Upon a child, that eyes the fruit and yields.</p>
<p>Into the fire before me then he walk'd;</p>
<p>And Statius, who erewhile no little space</p>
<p>Had parted us, he pray'd to come behind.</p>
<p class="slindent">I would have cast me into molten glass</p>
<p>To cool me, when I enter'd; so intense</p>
<p>Rag'd the conflagrant mass. The sire belov'd,</p>
<p>To comfort me, as he proceeded, still</p>
<p>Of Beatrice talk'd. "Her eyes," saith he,</p>
<p>&ldquo;E'en now I seem to view." From the other side</p>
<p>A voice, that sang, did guide us, and the voice</p>
<p>Following, with heedful ear, we issued forth,</p>
<p>There where the path led upward. "Come," we heard,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, blessed of my Father." Such the sounds,</p>
<p>That hail'd us from within a light, which shone</p>
<p>So radiant, I could not endure the view.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sun," it added, "hastes: and evening comes.</p>
<p>Delay not: ere the western sky is hung</p>
<p>With blackness, strive ye for the pass." Our way</p>
<p>Upright within the rock arose, and fac'd</p>
<p>Such part of heav'n, that from before my steps</p>
<p>The beams were shrouded of the sinking sun.</p>
<p class="slindent">Nor many stairs were overpass, when now</p>
<p>By fading of the shadow we perceiv'd</p>
<p>The sun behind us couch'd: and ere one face</p>
<p>Of darkness o'er its measureless expanse</p>
<p>Involv'd th' horizon, and the night her lot</p>
<p>Held individual, each of us had made</p>
<p>A stair his pallet: not that will, but power,</p>
<p>Had fail'd us, by the nature of that mount</p>
<p>Forbidden further travel. As the goats,</p>
<p>That late have skipp'd and wanton'd rapidly</p>
<p>Upon the craggy cliffs, ere they had ta'en</p>
<p>Their supper on the herb, now silent lie</p>
<p>And ruminate beneath the umbrage brown,</p>
<p>While noonday rages; and the goatherd leans</p>
<p>Upon his staff, and leaning watches them:</p>
<p>And as the swain, that lodges out all night</p>
<p>In quiet by his flock, lest beast of prey</p>
<p>Disperse them; even so all three abode,</p>
<p>I as a goat and as the shepherds they,</p>
<p>Close pent on either side by shelving rock.</p>
<p class="slindent">A little glimpse of sky was seen above;</p>
<p>Yet by that little I beheld the stars</p>
<p>In magnitude and rustle shining forth</p>
<p>With more than wonted glory. As I lay,</p>
<p>Gazing on them, and in that fit of musing,</p>
<p>Sleep overcame me, sleep, that bringeth oft</p>
<p>Tidings of future hap. About the hour,</p>
<p>As I believe, when Venus from the east</p>
<p>First lighten'd on the mountain, she whose orb</p>
<p>Seems always glowing with the fire of love,</p>
<p>A lady young and beautiful, I dream'd,</p>
<p>Was passing o'er a lea; and, as she came,</p>
<p>Methought I saw her ever and anon</p>
<p>Bending to cull the flowers; and thus she sang:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know ye, whoever of my name would ask,</p>
<p>That I am Leah: for my brow to weave</p>
<p>A garland, these fair hands unwearied ply.</p>
<p>To please me at the crystal mirror, here</p>
<p>I deck me. But my sister Rachel, she</p>
<p>Before her glass abides the livelong day,</p>
<p>Her radiant eyes beholding, charm'd no less,</p>
<p>Than I with this delightful task. Her joy</p>
<p>In contemplation, as in labour mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">And now as glimm'ring dawn appear'd, that breaks</p>
<p>More welcome to the pilgrim still, as he</p>
<p>Sojourns less distant on his homeward way,</p>
<p>Darkness from all sides fled, and with it fled</p>
<p>My slumber; whence I rose and saw my guide</p>
<p>Already risen. "That delicious fruit,</p>
<p>Which through so many a branch the zealous care</p>
<p>Of mortals roams in quest of, shall this day</p>
<p>Appease thy hunger." Such the words I heard</p>
<p>From Virgil's lip; and never greeting heard</p>
<p>So pleasant as the sounds. Within me straight</p>
<p>Desire so grew upon desire to mount,</p>
<p>Thenceforward at each step I felt the wings</p>
<p>Increasing for my flight. When we had run</p>
<p>O'er all the ladder to its topmost round,</p>
<p>As there we stood, on me the Mantuan fix'd</p>
<p>His eyes, and thus he spake: "Both fires, my son,</p>
<p>The temporal and eternal, thou hast seen,</p>
<p>And art arriv'd, where of itself my ken</p>
<p>No further reaches. I with skill and art</p>
<p>Thus far have drawn thee. Now thy pleasure take</p>
<p>For guide. Thou hast o'ercome the steeper way,</p>
<p>O'ercome the straighter. Lo! the sun, that darts</p>
<p>His beam upon thy forehead! lo! the herb,</p>
<p>The arboreta and flowers, which of itself</p>
<p>This land pours forth profuse! Till those bright eyes</p>
<p>With gladness come, which, weeping, made me haste</p>
<p>To succour thee, thou mayst or seat thee down,</p>
<p>Or wander where thou wilt. Expect no more</p>
<p>Sanction of warning voice or sign from me,</p>
<p>Free of thy own arbitrement to choose,</p>
<p>Discreet, judicious. To distrust thy sense</p>
<p>Were henceforth error. I invest thee then</p>
<p>With crown and mitre, sovereign o'er thyself.&rdquo;</p>

`<p class="cantohead">CANTO XXVIII</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>Through that celestial forest, whose thick shade</p>
<p>With lively greenness the new-springing day</p>
<p>Attemper'd, eager now to roam, and search</p>
<p>Its limits round, forthwith I left the bank,</p>
<p>Along the champain leisurely my way</p>
<p>Pursuing, o'er the ground, that on all sides</p>
<p>Delicious odour breath'd. A pleasant air,</p>
<p>That intermitted never, never veer'd,</p>
<p>Smote on my temples, gently, as a wind</p>
<p>Of softest influence: at which the sprays,</p>
<p>Obedient all, lean'd trembling to that part</p>
<p>Where first the holy mountain casts his shade,</p>
<p>Yet were not so disorder'd, but that still</p>
<p>Upon their top the feather'd quiristers</p>
<p>Applied their wonted art, and with full joy</p>
<p>Welcom'd those hours of prime, and warbled shrill</p>
<p>Amid the leaves, that to their jocund lays</p>
<p>inept tenor; even as from branch to branch,</p>
<p>Along the piney forests on the shore</p>
<p>Of Chiassi, rolls the gath'ring melody,</p>
<p>When Eolus hath from his cavern loos'd</p>
<p>The dripping south. Already had my steps,</p>
<p>Though slow, so far into that ancient wood</p>
<p>Transported me, I could not ken the place</p>
<p>Where I had enter'd, when behold! my path</p>
<p>Was bounded by a rill, which to the left</p>
<p>With little rippling waters bent the grass,</p>
<p>That issued from its brink. On earth no wave</p>
<p>How clean soe'er, that would not seem to have</p>
<p>Some mixture in itself, compar'd with this,</p>
<p>Transpicuous, clear; yet darkly on it roll'd,</p>
<p>Darkly beneath perpetual gloom, which ne'er</p>
<p>Admits or sun or moon light there to shine.</p>
<p class="slindent">My feet advanc'd not; but my wond'ring eyes</p>
<p>Pass'd onward, o'er the streamlet, to survey</p>
<p>The tender May-bloom, flush'd through many a hue,</p>
<p>In prodigal variety: and there,</p>
<p>As object, rising suddenly to view,</p>
<p>That from our bosom every thought beside</p>
<p>With the rare marvel chases, I beheld</p>
<p>A lady all alone, who, singing, went,</p>
<p>And culling flower from flower, wherewith her way</p>
<p>Was all o'er painted. "Lady beautiful!</p>
<p>Thou, who (if looks, that use to speak the heart,</p>
<p>Are worthy of our trust), with love's own beam</p>
<p>Dost warm thee," thus to her my speech I fram'd:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! please thee hither towards the streamlet bend</p>
<p>Thy steps so near, that I may list thy song.</p>
<p>Beholding thee and this fair place, methinks,</p>
<p>I call to mind where wander'd and how look'd</p>
<p>Proserpine, in that season, when her child</p>
<p>The mother lost, and she the bloomy spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">As when a lady, turning in the dance,</p>
<p>Doth foot it featly, and advances scarce</p>
<p>One step before the other to the ground;</p>
<p>Over the yellow and vermilion flowers</p>
<p>Thus turn'd she at my suit, most maiden-like,</p>
<p>Valing her sober eyes, and came so near,</p>
<p>That I distinctly caught the dulcet sound.</p>
<p>Arriving where the limped waters now</p>
<p>Lav'd the green sward, her eyes she deign'd to raise,</p>
<p>That shot such splendour on me, as I ween</p>
<p>Ne'er glanced from Cytherea's, when her son</p>
<p>Had sped his keenest weapon to her heart.</p>
<p>Upon the opposite bank she stood and smil'd</p>
<p>through her graceful fingers shifted still</p>
<p>The intermingling dyes, which without seed</p>
<p>That lofty land unbosoms. By the stream</p>
<p>Three paces only were we sunder'd: yet</p>
<p>The Hellespont, where Xerxes pass'd it o'er,</p>
<p>(A curb for ever to the pride of man)</p>
<p>Was by Leander not more hateful held</p>
<p>For floating, with inhospitable wave</p>
<p>'Twixt Sestus and Abydos, than by me</p>
<p>That flood, because it gave no passage thence.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Strangers ye come, and haply in this place,</p>
<p>That cradled human nature in its birth,</p>
<p>Wond'ring, ye not without suspicion view</p>

<p>'Thou, Lord! hast made me glad,' will give ye light,</p>
<p>Which may uncloud your minds. And thou, who stand'st</p>
<p>The foremost, and didst make thy suit to me,</p>
<p>Say if aught else thou wish to hear: for I</p>
<p>Came prompt to answer every doubt of thine.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">She spake; and I replied: "l know not how</p>
<p>To reconcile this wave and rustling sound</p>
<p>Of forest leaves, with what I late have heard</p>
<p>Of opposite report." She answering thus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will unfold the cause, whence that proceeds,</p>
<p>Which makes thee wonder; and so purge the cloud</p>
<p>That hath enwraps thee. The First Good, whose joy</p>
<p>Is only in himself, created man</p>
<p>For happiness, and gave this goodly place,</p>
<p>His pledge and earnest of eternal peace.</p>
<p>Favour'd thus highly, through his own defect</p>
<p>He fell, and here made short sojourn; he fell,</p>
<p>And, for the bitterness of sorrow, chang'd</p>
<p>Laughter unblam'd and ever-new delight.</p>
<p>That vapours none, exhal'd from earth beneath,</p>
<p>Or from the waters (which, wherever heat</p>
<p>Attracts them, follow), might ascend thus far</p>
<p>To vex man's peaceful state, this mountain rose</p>
<p>So high toward the heav'n, nor fears the rage</p>
<p>0f elements contending, from that part</p>
<p>Exempted, where the gate his limit bars.</p>
<p>Because the circumambient air throughout</p>
<p>With its first impulse circles still, unless</p>
<p>Aught interpose to cheek or thwart its course;</p>
<p>Upon the summit, which on every side</p>
<p>To visitation of th' impassive air</p>
<p>Is open, doth that motion strike, and makes</p>
<p>Beneath its sway th' umbrageous wood resound:</p>
<p>And in the shaken plant such power resides,</p>
<p>That it impregnates with its efficacy</p>
<p>The voyaging breeze, upon whose subtle plume</p>
<p>That wafted flies abroad; and th' other land</p>
<p>Receiving (as 't is worthy in itself,</p>
<p>Or in the clime, that warms it), doth conceive,</p>
<p>And from its womb produces many a tree</p>
<p>Of various virtue. This when thou hast heard,</p>
<p>The marvel ceases, if in yonder earth</p>
<p>Some plant without apparent seed be found</p>
<p>To fix its fibrous stem. And further learn,</p>
<p>That with prolific foison of all seeds,</p>
<p>This holy plain is fill'd, and in itself</p>
<p>Bears fruit that ne'er was pluck'd on other soil.</p>
<p> "The water, thou behold'st, springs not from vein,</p>
<p>As stream, that intermittently repairs</p>
<p>And spends his pulse of life, but issues forth</p>
<p>From fountain, solid, undecaying, sure;</p>
<p>And by the will omnific, full supply</p>
<p>Feeds whatsoe'er On either side it pours;</p>
<p>On this devolv'd with power to take away</p>
<p>Remembrance of offence, on that to bring</p>
<p>Remembrance back of every good deed done.</p>
<p>From whence its name of Lethe on this part;</p>
<p>On th' other Eunoe: both of which must first</p>
<p>Be tasted ere it work; the last exceeding</p>
<p>All flavours else. Albeit thy thirst may now</p>
<p>Be well contented, if I here break off,</p>
<p>No more revealing: yet a corollary</p>
<p>I freely give beside: nor deem my words</p>
<p>Less grateful to thee, if they somewhat pass</p>
<p>The stretch of promise. They, whose verse of yore</p>
<p>The golden age recorded and its bliss,</p>
<p>On the Parnassian mountain, of this place</p>
<p>Perhaps had dream'd. Here was man guiltless, here</p>
<p>Perpetual spring and every fruit, and this</p>
<p>The far-fam'd nectar." Turning to the bards,</p>

<div class="stanza"><p>Singing, as if enamour'd, she resum'd</p>
<p>And clos'd the song, with "Blessed they whose sins</p>

<p>Singly across the sylvan shadows, one</p>
<p>Eager to view and one to 'scape the sun,</p>
<p>So mov'd she on, against the current, up</p>
<p>The verdant rivage. I, her mincing step</p>
<p>Observing, with as tardy step pursued.</p>
<p class="slindent">Between us not an hundred paces trod,</p>
<p>The bank, on each side bending equally,</p>
<p>Gave me to face the orient. Nor our way</p>
<p>Far onward brought us, when to me at once</p>
<p>She turn'd, and cried: "My brother! look and hearken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And lo! a sudden lustre ran across</p>
<p>Through the great forest on all parts, so bright</p>
<p>I doubted whether lightning were abroad;</p>
<p>But that expiring ever in the spleen,</p>
<p>That doth unfold it, and this during still</p>
<p>And waxing still in splendor, made me question</p>
<p>What it might be: and a sweet melody</p>
<p>Ran through the luminous air. Then did I chide</p>
<p>With warrantable zeal the hardihood</p>
<p>Of our first parent, for that there were earth</p>
<p>Stood in obedience to the heav'ns, she only,</p>
<p>Woman, the creature of an hour, endur'd not</p>
<p>Restraint of any veil: which had she borne</p>
<p>Devoutly, joys, ineffable as these,</p>
<p>Had from the first, and long time since, been mine.</p>
<p class="slindent">While through that wilderness of primy sweets</p>
<p>That never fade, suspense I walk'd, and yet</p>
<p>Expectant of beatitude more high,</p>
<p>Before us, like a blazing fire, the air</p>
<p>Under the green boughs glow'd; and, for a song,</p>
<p>Distinct the sound of melody was heard.</p>
<p class="slindent">O ye thrice holy virgins! for your sakes</p>
<p>If e'er I suffer'd hunger, cold and watching,</p>
<p>Occasion calls on me to crave your bounty.</p>
<p>Now through my breast let Helicon his stream</p>
<p>Pour copious; and Urania with her choir</p>
<p>Arise to aid me: while the verse unfolds</p>
<p>Things that do almost mock the grasp of thought.</p>
<p class="slindent">Onward a space, what seem'd seven trees of gold,</p>
<p>The intervening distance to mine eye</p>
<p>Falsely presented; but when I was come</p>
<p>So near them, that no lineament was lost</p>
<p>Of those, with which a doubtful object, seen</p>
<p>Remotely, plays on the misdeeming sense,</p>
<p>Then did the faculty, that ministers</p>
<p>Discourse to reason, these for tapers of gold</p>
<p>Distinguish, and it th' singing trace the sound</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hosanna." Above, their beauteous garniture</p>
<p>Flam'd with more ample lustre, than the moon</p>
<p>Through cloudless sky at midnight in her full.</p>
<p class="slindent">I turn'd me full of wonder to my guide;</p>
<p>And he did answer with a countenance</p>
<p>Charg'd with no less amazement: whence my view</p>
<p>Reverted to those lofty things, which came</p>
<p>So slowly moving towards us, that the bride</p>
<p>Would have outstript them on her bridal day.</p>
<p class="slindent">The lady called aloud: "Why thus yet burns</p>
<p>Affection in thee for these living, lights,</p>
<p>And dost not look on that which follows them?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">I straightway mark'd a tribe behind them walk,</p>
<p>As if attendant on their leaders, cloth'd</p>
<p>With raiment of such whiteness, as on earth</p>
<p>Was never. On my left, the wat'ry gleam</p>
<p>Borrow'd, and gave me back, when there I look'd.</p>
<p>As in a mirror, my left side portray'd.</p>
<p class="slindent">When I had chosen on the river's edge</p>
<p>Such station, that the distance of the stream</p>
<p>Alone did separate me; there I stay'd</p>
<p>My steps for clearer prospect, and beheld</p>
<p>The flames go onward, leaving, as they went,</p>
<p>The air behind them painted as with trail</p>
<p>Of liveliest pencils! so distinct were mark'd</p>
<p>All those sev'n listed colours, whence the sun</p>
<p>Maketh his bow, and Cynthia her zone.</p>
<p>These streaming gonfalons did flow beyond</p>
<p>My vision; and ten paces, as I guess,</p>
<p>Parted the outermost. Beneath a sky</p>
<p>So beautiful, came foul and-twenty elders,</p>
<p>By two and two, with flower-de-luces crown'd.</p>
<p>All sang one song: "Blessed be thou among</p>
<p>The daughters of Adam! and thy loveliness</p>
<p>Blessed for ever!" After that the flowers,</p>
<p>And the fresh herblets, on the opposite brink,</p>
<p>Were free from that elected race; as light</p>
<p>In heav'n doth second light, came after them</p>
<p>Four animals, each crown'd with verdurous leaf.</p>
<p>With six wings each was plum'd, the plumage full</p>
<p>Of eyes, and th' eyes of Argus would be such,</p>
<p>Were they endued with life. Reader, more rhymes</p>
<p>Will not waste in shadowing forth their form:</p>
<p>For other need no straitens, that in this</p>
<p>I may not give my bounty room. But read</p>
<p>Ezekiel; for he paints them, from the north</p>
<p>How he beheld them come by Chebar's flood,</p>
<p>In whirlwind, cloud and fire; and even such</p>
<p>As thou shalt find them character'd by him,</p>
<p>Here were they; save as to the pennons; there,</p>
<p>From him departing, John accords with me.</p>
<p class="slindent">The space, surrounded by the four, enclos'd</p>
<p>A car triumphal: on two wheels it came</p>
<p>Drawn at a Gryphon's neck; and he above</p>
<p>Stretch'd either wing uplifted, 'tween the midst</p>
<p>And the three listed hues, on each side three;</p>
<p>So that the wings did cleave or injure none;</p>
<p>And out of sight they rose. The members, far</p>
<p>As he was bird, were golden; white the rest</p>
<p>With vermeil intervein'd. So beautiful</p>
<p>A car in Rome ne'er grac'd Augustus pomp,</p>
<p>Or Africanus': e'en the sun's itself</p>
<p>Were poor to this, that chariot of the sun</p>
<p>Erroneous, which in blazing ruin fell</p>
<p>At Tellus' pray'r devout, by the just doom</p>
<p>Mysterious of all-seeing Jove. Three nymphs</p>
<p>,k the right wheel, came circling in smooth dance;</p>
<p>The one so ruddy, that her form had scarce</p>
<p>Been known within a furnace of clear flame:</p>
<p>The next did look, as if the flesh and bones</p>
<p>Were emerald: snow new-fallen seem'd the third.</p>
<p>Now seem'd the white to lead, the ruddy now;</p>
<p>And from her song who led, the others took</p>
<p>Their treasure, swift or slow. At th' other wheel,</p>
<p>A band quaternion, each in purple clad,</p>
<p>Advanc'd with festal step, as of them one</p>
<p>The rest conducted, one, upon whose front</p>
<p>Three eyes were seen. In rear of all this group,</p>
<p>Two old men I beheld, dissimilar</p>
<p>In raiment, but in port and gesture like,</p>
<p>Solid and mainly grave; of whom the one</p>
<p>Did show himself some favour'd counsellor</p>
<p>Of the great Coan, him, whom nature made</p>
<p>To serve the costliest creature of her tribe.</p>
<p>His fellow mark'd an opposite intent,</p>
<p>Bearing a sword, whose glitterance and keen edge,</p>
<p>E'en as I view'd it with the flood between,</p>
<p>Appall'd me. Next four others I beheld,</p>
<p>Of humble seeming: and, behind them all,</p>
<p>One single old man, sleeping, as he came,</p>
<p>With a shrewd visage. And these seven, each</p>
<p>Like the first troop were habited, hut wore</p>
<p>No braid of lilies on their temples wreath'd.</p>
<p>Rather with roses and each vermeil flower,</p>
<p>A sight, but little distant, might have sworn,</p>
<p>That they were all on fire above their brow.</p>
<p class="slindent">Whenas the car was o'er against me, straight.</p>
<p>Was heard a thund'ring, at whose voice it seem'd</p>
<p>The chosen multitude were stay'd; for there,</p>
<p>With the first ensigns, made they solemn halt.</p>

<p>Setting nor rising, nor the shadowy veil</p>
<p>Of other cloud than sin, fair ornament</p>
<p>Of the first heav'n, to duty each one there</p>
<p>Safely convoying, as that lower doth</p>
<p>The steersman to his port, stood firmly fix'd;</p>
<p>Forthwith the saintly tribe, who in the van</p>
<p>Between the Gryphon and its radiance came,</p>
<p>Did turn them to the car, as to their rest:</p>
<p>And one, as if commission'd from above,</p>
<p>In holy chant thrice shorted forth aloud:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, spouse, from Libanus!" and all the rest</p>
<p>Took up the song&mdash;At the last audit so</p>
<p>The blest shall rise, from forth his cavern each</p>
<p>Uplifting lightly his new-vested flesh,</p>
<p>As, on the sacred litter, at the voice</p>
<p>Authoritative of that elder, sprang</p>
<p>A hundred ministers and messengers</p>
<p>Of life eternal. "Blessed thou! who com'st!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, "O," they cried, "from full hands scatter ye</p>
<p>Unwith'ring lilies;" and, so saying, cast</p>
<p>Flowers over head and round them on all sides.</p>
<p class="slindent">I have beheld, ere now, at break of day,</p>
<p>The eastern clime all roseate, and the sky</p>
<p>Oppos'd, one deep and beautiful serene,</p>
<p>And the sun's face so shaded, and with mists</p>
<p>Attemper'd at lids rising, that the eye</p>
<p>Long while endur'd the sight: thus in a cloud</p>
<p>Of flowers, that from those hands angelic rose,</p>
<p>And down, within and outside of the car,</p>
<p>Fell showering, in white veil with olive wreath'd,</p>
<p>A virgin in my view appear'd, beneath</p>
<p>Green mantle, rob'd in hue of living flame:</p>
<p>And o'er my Spirit, that in former days</p>
<p>Within her presence had abode so long,</p>
<p>No shudd'ring terror crept. Mine eyes no more</p>
<p>Had knowledge of her; yet there mov'd from her</p>
<p>A hidden virtue, at whose touch awak'd,</p>
<p>The power of ancient love was strong within me.</p>
<p class="slindent">No sooner on my vision streaming, smote</p>
<p>The heav'nly influence, which years past, and e'en</p>
<p>In childhood, thrill'd me, than towards Virgil I</p>
<p>Turn'd me to leftward, panting, like a babe,</p>
<p>That flees for refuge to his mother's breast,</p>
<p>If aught have terrified or work'd him woe:</p>
<p>And would have cried: "There is no dram of blood,</p>
<p>That doth not quiver in me. The old flame</p>
<p>Throws out clear tokens of reviving fire:&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Virgil had bereav'd us of himself,</p>
<p>Virgil, my best-lov'd father; Virgil, he</p>
<p>To whom I gave me up for safety: nor,</p>
<p>All, our prime mother lost, avail'd to save</p>
<p>My undew'd cheeks from blur of soiling tears.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Dante, weep not, that Virgil leaves thee: nay,</p>
<p>Weep thou not yet: behooves thee feel the edge</p>
<p>Of other sword, and thou shalt weep for that.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">As to the prow or stern, some admiral</p>
<p>Paces the deck, inspiriting his crew,</p>
<p>When 'mid the sail-yards all hands ply aloof;</p>
<p>Thus on the left side of the car I saw,</p>
<p>(Turning me at the sound of mine own name,</p>
<p>Which here I am compell'd to register)</p>
<p>The virgin station'd, who before appeared</p>
<p>Veil'd in that festive shower angelical.</p>
<p class="slindent">Towards me, across the stream, she bent her eyes;</p>
<p>Though from her brow the veil descending, bound</p>
<p>With foliage of Minerva, suffer'd not</p>
<p>That I beheld her clearly; then with act</p>
<p>Full royal, still insulting o'er her thrall,</p>
<p>Added, as one, who speaking keepeth back</p>
<p>The bitterest saying, to conclude the speech:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Observe me well. I am, in sooth, I am</p>
<p>Beatrice. What! and hast thou deign'd at last</p>
<p>Approach the mountain? knewest not, O man!</p>
<p>Thy happiness is whole?" Down fell mine eyes</p>
<p>On the clear fount, but there, myself espying,</p>
<p>Recoil'd, and sought the greensward: such a weight</p>
<p>Of shame was on my forehead. With a mien</p>
<p>Of that stern majesty, which doth surround</p>
<p>mother's presence to her awe-struck child,</p>
<p>She look'd; a flavour of such bitterness</p>
<p>Was mingled in her pity. There her words</p>
<p>Brake off, and suddenly the angels sang:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In thee, O gracious Lord, my hope hath been:&rdquo;</p>
<p>But went no farther than, "Thou Lord, hast set</p>
<p>My feet in ample room." As snow, that lies</p>
<p>Amidst the living rafters on the back</p>
<p>Of Italy congeal'd when drifted high</p>
<p>And closely pil'd by rough Sclavonian blasts,</p>
<p>Breathe but the land whereon no shadow falls,</p>
<p>And straightway melting it distils away,</p>
<p>Like a fire-wasted taper: thus was I,</p>
<p>Without a sigh or tear, or ever these</p>
<p>Did sing, that with the chiming of heav'n's sphere,</p>
<p>Still in their warbling chime: but when the strain</p>
<p>Of dulcet symphony, express'd for me</p>
<p>Their soft compassion, more than could the words</p>
<p>&ldquo;Virgin, why so consum'st him?" then the ice,</p>
<p>Congeal'd about my bosom, turn'd itself</p>
<p>To spirit and water, and with anguish forth</p>
<p>Gush'd through the lips and eyelids from the heart.</p>
<p class="slindent">Upon the chariot's right edge still she stood,</p>
<p>Immovable, and thus address'd her words</p>
<p>To those bright semblances with pity touch'd:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye in th' eternal day your vigils keep,</p>
<p>So that nor night nor slumber, with close stealth,</p>
<p>Conveys from you a single step in all</p>
<p>The goings on of life: thence with more heed</p>
<p>I shape mine answer, for his ear intended,</p>
<p>Who there stands weeping, that the sorrow now</p>
<p>May equal the transgression. Not alone</p>
<p>Through operation of the mighty orbs,</p>
<p>That mark each seed to some predestin'd aim,</p>
<p>As with aspect or fortunate or ill</p>
<p>The constellations meet, but through benign</p>
<p>Largess of heav'nly graces, which rain down</p>
<p>From such a height, as mocks our vision, this man</p>
<p>Was in the freshness of his being, such,</p>
<p>So gifted virtually, that in him</p>
<p>All better habits wond'rously had thriv'd.</p>
<p>The more of kindly strength is in the soil,</p>
<p>So much doth evil seed and lack of culture</p>
<p>Mar it the more, and make it run to wildness.</p>
<p>These looks sometime upheld him; for I show'd</p>
<p>My youthful eyes, and led him by their light</p>
<p>In upright walking. Soon as I had reach'd</p>
<p>The threshold of my second age, and chang'd</p>
<p>My mortal for immortal, then he left me,</p>
<p>And gave himself to others. When from flesh</p>
<p>To spirit I had risen, and increase</p>
<p>Of beauty and of virtue circled me,</p>
<p>I was less dear to him, and valued less.</p>
<p>His steps were turn'd into deceitful ways,</p>
<p>Following false images of good, that make</p>
<p>No promise perfect. Nor avail'd me aught</p>
<p>To sue for inspirations, with the which,</p>
<p>I, both in dreams of night, and otherwise,</p>
<p>Did call him back; of them so little reck'd him,</p>
<p>Such depth he fell, that all device was short</p>
<p>Of his preserving, save that he should view</p>
<p>The children of perdition. To this end</p>
<p>I visited the purlieus of the dead:</p>
<p>And one, who hath conducted him thus high,</p>
<p>Receiv'd my supplications urg'd with weeping.</p>
<p>It were a breaking of God's high decree,</p>
<p>If Lethe should be past, and such food tasted</p>
<p>Without the cost of some repentant tear.&rdquo;</p>

`<p class="cantohead">CANTO XXXI</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;O Thou!" her words she thus without delay</p>
<p>Resuming, turn'd their point on me, to whom</p>
<p>They but with lateral edge seem'd harsh before,</p>
<p>'Say thou, who stand'st beyond the holy stream,</p>
<p>If this be true. A charge so grievous needs</p>
<p>Thine own avowal." On my faculty</p>
<p>Such strange amazement hung, the voice expir'd</p>
<p>Imperfect, ere its organs gave it birth.</p>
<p class="slindent">A little space refraining, then she spake:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What dost thou muse on? Answer me. The wave</p>
<p>On thy remembrances of evil yet</p>
<p>Hath done no injury." A mingled sense</p>
<p>Of fear and of confusion, from my lips</p>
<p>Did such a "Yea " produce, as needed help</p>
<p>Of vision to interpret. As when breaks</p>
<p>In act to be discharg'd, a cross-bow bent</p>
<p>Beyond its pitch, both nerve and bow o'erstretch'd,</p>
<p>The flagging weapon feebly hits the mark;</p>
<p>Thus, tears and sighs forth gushing, did I burst</p>
<p>Beneath the heavy load, and thus my voice</p>
<p>Was slacken'd on its way. She straight began:</p>
<p>&ldquo;When my desire invited thee to love</p>
<p>The good, which sets a bound to our aspirings,</p>
<p>What bar of thwarting foss or linked chain</p>
<p>Did meet thee, that thou so should'st quit the hope</p>
<p>Of further progress, or what bait of ease</p>
<p>Or promise of allurement led thee on</p>
<p>Elsewhere, that thou elsewhere should'st rather wait?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">A bitter sigh I drew, then scarce found voice</p>
<p>To answer, hardly to these sounds my lips</p>
<p>Gave utterance, wailing: "Thy fair looks withdrawn,</p>
<p>Things present, with deceitful pleasures, turn'd</p>
<p>My steps aside." She answering spake: "Hadst thou</p>
<p>Been silent, or denied what thou avow'st,</p>
<p>Thou hadst not hid thy sin the more: such eye</p>
<p>Observes it. But whene'er the sinner's cheek</p>
<p>Breaks forth into the precious-streaming tears</p>
<p>Of self-accusing, in our court the wheel</p>
<p>Of justice doth run counter to the edge.</p>
<p>Howe'er that thou may'st profit by thy shame</p>
<p>For errors past, and that henceforth more strength</p>
<p>May arm thee, when thou hear'st the Siren-voice,</p>
<p>Lay thou aside the motive to this grief,</p>
<p>And lend attentive ear, while I unfold</p>
<p>How opposite a way my buried flesh</p>
<p>Should have impell'd thee. Never didst thou spy</p>
<p>In art or nature aught so passing sweet,</p>
<p>As were the limbs, that in their beauteous frame</p>
<p>Enclos'd me, and are scatter'd now in dust.</p>
<p>If sweetest thing thus fail'd thee with my death,</p>
<p>What, afterward, of mortal should thy wish</p>
<p>Have tempted? When thou first hadst felt the dart</p>
<p>Of perishable things, in my departing</p>
<p>For better realms, thy wing thou should'st have prun'd</p>
<p>To follow me, and never stoop'd again</p>
<p>To 'bide a second blow for a slight girl,</p>
<p>Or other gaud as transient and as vain.</p>
<p>The new and inexperienc'd bird awaits,</p>
<p>Twice it may be, or thrice, the fowler's aim;</p>
<p>But in the sight of one, whose plumes are full,</p>
<p>In vain the net is spread, the arrow wing'd.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">I stood, as children silent and asham'd</p>
<p>Stand, list'ning, with their eyes upon the earth,</p>
<p>Acknowledging their fault and self-condemn'd.</p>
<p>And she resum'd: "If, but to hear thus pains thee,</p>
<p>Raise thou thy beard, and lo! what sight shall do!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">With less reluctance yields a sturdy holm,</p>
<p>Rent from its fibers by a blast, that blows</p>
<p>From off the pole, or from Iarbas' land,</p>
<p>Than I at her behest my visage rais'd:</p>
<p>And thus the face denoting by the beard,</p>
<p>I mark'd the secret sting her words convey'd.</p>
<p class="slindent">No sooner lifted I mine aspect up,</p>
<p>Than downward sunk that vision I beheld</p>
<p>Of goodly creatures vanish; and mine eyes</p>
<p>Yet unassur'd and wavering, bent their light</p>
<p>On Beatrice. Towards the animal,</p>
<p>Who joins two natures in one form, she turn'd,</p>
<p>And, even under shadow of her veil,</p>
<p>And parted by the verdant rill, that flow'd</p>
<p>Between, in loveliness appear'd as much</p>
<p>Her former self surpassing, as on earth</p>
<p>All others she surpass'd. Remorseful goads</p>
<p>Shot sudden through me. Each thing else, the more</p>
<p>Its love had late beguil'd me, now the more</p>
<p>I Was loathsome. On my heart so keenly smote</p>
<p>The bitter consciousness, that on the ground</p>
<p>O'erpower'd I fell: and what my state was then,</p>
<p>She knows who was the cause. When now my strength</p>
<p>Flow'd back, returning outward from the heart,</p>
<p>The lady, whom alone I first had seen,</p>
<p>I found above me. "Loose me not," she cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Loose not thy hold;" and lo! had dragg'd me high</p>
<p>As to my neck into the stream, while she,</p>
<p>Still as she drew me after, swept along,</p>
<p>Swift as a shuttle, bounding o'er the wave.</p>
<p class="slindent">The blessed shore approaching then was heard</p>
<p>So sweetly, "Tu asperges me," that I</p>
<p>May not remember, much less tell the sound.</p>
<p>The beauteous dame, her arms expanding, clasp'd</p>
<p>My temples, and immerg'd me, where 't was fit</p>
<p>The wave should drench me: and thence raising up,</p>
<p>Within the fourfold dance of lovely nymphs</p>
<p>Presented me so lav'd, and with their arm</p>
<p>They each did cover me. "Here are we nymphs,</p>
<p>And in the heav'n are stars. Or ever earth</p>
<p>Was visited of Beatrice, we</p>
<p>Appointed for her handmaids, tended on her.</p>
<p>We to her eyes will lead thee; but the light</p>
<p>Of gladness that is in them, well to scan,</p>
<p>Those yonder three, of deeper ken than ours,</p>
<p>Thy sight shall quicken." Thus began their song;</p>
<p>And then they led me to the Gryphon's breast,</p>
<p>While, turn'd toward us, Beatrice stood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spare not thy vision. We have stationed thee</p>
<p>Before the emeralds, whence love erewhile</p>
<p>Hath drawn his weapons on thee. "As they spake,</p>
<p>A thousand fervent wishes riveted</p>
<p>Mine eyes upon her beaming eyes, that stood</p>
<p>Still fix'd toward the Gryphon motionless.</p>
<p>As the sun strikes a mirror, even thus</p>
<p>Within those orbs the twofold being, shone,</p>
<p>For ever varying, in one figure now</p>
<p>Reflected, now in other. Reader! muse</p>
<p>How wond'rous in my sight it seem'd to mark</p>
<p>A thing, albeit steadfast in itself,</p>
<p>Yet in its imag'd semblance mutable.</p>
<p class="slindent">Full of amaze, and joyous, while my soul</p>
<p>Fed on the viand, whereof still desire</p>
<p>Grows with satiety, the other three</p>
<p>With gesture, that declar'd a loftier line,</p>
<p>Advanc'd: to their own carol on they came</p>
<p>Dancing in festive ring angelical.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Turn, Beatrice!" was their song: "O turn</p>
<p>Thy saintly sight on this thy faithful one,</p>
<p>Who to behold thee many a wearisome pace</p>
<p>Hath measur'd. Gracious at our pray'r vouchsafe</p>
<p>Unveil to him thy cheeks: that he may mark</p>
<p>Thy second beauty, now conceal'd." O splendour!</p>
<p>O sacred light eternal! who is he</p>
<p>So pale with musing in Pierian shades,</p>
<p>Or with that fount so lavishly imbued,</p>
<p>Whose spirit should not fail him in th' essay</p>
<p>To represent thee such as thou didst seem,</p>
<p>When under cope of the still-chiming heaven</p>
<p>Thou gav'st to open air thy charms reveal'd.</p>

`<p class="cantohead">CANTO XXXII</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>Mine eyes with such an eager coveting,</p>
<p>Were bent to rid them of their ten years' thirst,</p>
<p>No other sense was waking: and e'en they</p>
<p>Were fenc'd on either side from heed of aught;</p>
<p>So tangled in its custom'd toils that smile</p>
<p>Of saintly brightness drew me to itself,</p>
<p>When forcibly toward the left my sight</p>
<p>The sacred virgins turn'd; for from their lips</p>
<p>I heard the warning sounds: "Too fix'd a gaze!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Awhile my vision labor'd; as when late</p>
<p>Upon the' o'erstrained eyes the sun hath smote:</p>
<p>But soon to lesser object, as the view</p>
<p>Was now recover'd (lesser in respect</p>
<p>To that excess of sensible, whence late</p>
<p>I had perforce been sunder'd) on their right</p>
<p>I mark'd that glorious army wheel, and turn,</p>
<p>Against the sun and sev'nfold lights, their front.</p>
<p>As when, their bucklers for protection rais'd,</p>
<p>A well-rang'd troop, with portly banners curl'd,</p>
<p>Wheel circling, ere the whole can change their ground:</p>
<p>E'en thus the goodly regiment of heav'n</p>
<p>Proceeding, all did pass us, ere the car</p>
<p>Had slop'd his beam. Attendant at the wheels</p>
<p>The damsels turn'd; and on the Gryphon mov'd</p>
<p>The sacred burden, with a pace so smooth,</p>
<p>No feather on him trembled. The fair dame</p>
<p>Who through the wave had drawn me, companied</p>
<p>By Statius and myself, pursued the wheel,</p>
<p>Whose orbit, rolling, mark'd a lesser arch.</p>
<p class="slindent">Through the high wood, now void (the more her blame,</p>
<p>Who by the serpent was beguil'd) I past</p>
<p>With step in cadence to the harmony</p>
<p>Angelic. Onward had we mov'd, as far</p>
<p>Perchance as arrow at three several flights</p>
<p>Full wing'd had sped, when from her station down</p>
<p>Descended Beatrice. With one voice</p>
<p>All murmur'd "Adam," circling next a plant</p>
<p>Despoil'd of flowers and leaf on every bough.</p>
<p>Its tresses, spreading more as more they rose,</p>
<p>Were such, as 'midst their forest wilds for height</p>
<p>The Indians might have gaz'd at. "Blessed thou!</p>
<p>Gryphon, whose beak hath never pluck'd that tree</p>
<p>Pleasant to taste: for hence the appetite</p>
<p>Was warp'd to evil." Round the stately trunk</p>
<p>Thus shouted forth the rest, to whom return'd</p>
<p>The animal twice-gender'd: "Yea: for so</p>
<p>The generation of the just are sav'd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And turning to the chariot-pole, to foot</p>
<p>He drew it of the widow'd branch, and bound</p>
<p>There left unto the stock whereon it grew.</p>
<p class="slindent">As when large floods of radiance from above</p>
<p>Stream, with that radiance mingled, which ascends</p>
<p>Next after setting of the scaly sign,</p>
<p>Our plants then burgeon, and each wears anew</p>
<p>His wonted colours, ere the sun have yok'd</p>
<p>Beneath another star his flamy steeds;</p>
<p>Thus putting forth a hue, more faint than rose,</p>
<p>And deeper than the violet, was renew'd</p>
<p>The plant, erewhile in all its branches bare.</p>
<p class="slindent">Unearthly was the hymn, which then arose.</p>
<p>I understood it not, nor to the end</p>
<p>Endur'd the harmony. Had I the skill</p>
<p>To pencil forth, how clos'd th' unpitying eyes</p>
<p>Slumb'ring, when Syrinx warbled, (eyes that paid</p>
<p>So dearly for their watching,) then like painter,</p>
<p>That with a model paints, I might design</p>
<p>The manner of my falling into sleep.</p>
<p>But feign who will the slumber cunningly;</p>
<p>I pass it by to when I wak'd, and tell</p>
<p>How suddenly a flash of splendour rent</p>
<p>The curtain of my sleep, and one cries out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arise, what dost thou?" As the chosen three,</p>
<p>On Tabor's mount, admitted to behold</p>
<p>The blossoming of that fair tree, whose fruit</p>
<p>Is coveted of angels, and doth make</p>
<p>Perpetual feast in heaven, to themselves</p>
<p>Returning at the word, whence deeper sleeps</p>
<p>Were broken, that they their tribe diminish'd saw,</p>
<p>Both Moses and Elias gone, and chang'd</p>
<p>The stole their master wore: thus to myself</p>
<p>Returning, over me beheld I stand</p>
<p>The piteous one, who cross the stream had brought</p>
<p>My steps. "And where," all doubting, I exclaim'd,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Beatrice?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;See her," she replied,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beneath the fresh leaf seated on its root.</p>
<p>Behold th' associate choir that circles her.</p>
<p>The others, with a melody more sweet</p>
<p>And more profound, journeying to higher realms,</p>
<p>Upon the Gryphon tend." If there her words</p>
<p>Were clos'd, I know not; but mine eyes had now</p>
<p>Ta'en view of her, by whom all other thoughts</p>
<p>Were barr'd admittance. On the very ground</p>
<p>Alone she sat, as she had there been left</p>
<p>A guard upon the wain, which I beheld</p>
<p>Bound to the twyform beast. The seven nymphs</p>
<p>Did make themselves a cloister round about her,</p>
<p>And in their hands upheld those lights secure</p>
<p>From blast septentrion and the gusty south.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;A little while thou shalt be forester here:</p>
<p>And citizen shalt be forever with me,</p>
<p>Of that true Rome, wherein Christ dwells a Roman</p>
<p>To profit the misguided world, keep now</p>
<p>Thine eyes upon the car; and what thou seest,</p>
<p>Take heed thou write, returning to that place.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Thus Beatrice: at whose feet inclin'd</p>
<p>Devout, at her behest, my thought and eyes,</p>
<p>I, as she bade, directed. Never fire,</p>
<p>With so swift motion, forth a stormy cloud</p>
<p>Leap'd downward from the welkin's farthest bound,</p>
<p>As I beheld the bird of Jove descending</p>
<p>Pounce on the tree, and, as he rush'd, the rind,</p>
<p>Disparting crush beneath him, buds much more</p>
<p>And leaflets. On the car with all his might</p>
<p>He struck, whence, staggering like a ship, it reel'd,</p>
<p>At random driv'n, to starboard now, o'ercome,</p>
<p>And now to larboard, by the vaulting waves.</p>
<p class="slindent">Next springing up into the chariot's womb</p>
<p>A fox I saw, with hunger seeming pin'd</p>
<p>Of all good food. But, for his ugly sins</p>
<p>The saintly maid rebuking him, away</p>
<p>Scamp'ring he turn'd, fast as his hide-bound corpse</p>
<p>Would bear him. Next, from whence before he came,</p>
<p>I saw the eagle dart into the hull</p>
<p>O' th' car, and leave it with his feathers lin'd;</p>
<p>And then a voice, like that which issues forth</p>
<p>From heart with sorrow riv'd, did issue forth</p>
<p>From heav'n, and, "O poor bark of mine!" it cried,</p>
<p>&ldquo;How badly art thou freighted!" Then, it seem'd,</p>
<p>That the earth open'd between either wheel,</p>
<p>And I beheld a dragon issue thence,</p>
<p>That through the chariot fix'd his forked train;</p>
<p>And like a wasp that draggeth back the sting,</p>
<p>So drawing forth his baleful train, he dragg'd</p>
<p>Part of the bottom forth, and went his way</p>
<p>Exulting. What remain'd, as lively turf</p>
<p>With green herb, so did clothe itself with plumes,</p>
<p>Which haply had with purpose chaste and kind</p>
<p>Been offer'd; and therewith were cloth'd the wheels,</p>
<p>Both one and other, and the beam, so quickly</p>
<p>A sigh were not breath'd sooner. Thus transform'd,</p>
<p>The holy structure, through its several parts,</p>
<p>Did put forth heads, three on the beam, and one</p>
<p>On every side; the first like oxen horn'd,</p>
<p>But with a single horn upon their front</p>
<p>The four. Like monster sight hath never seen.</p>
<p>O'er it methought there sat, secure as rock</p>
<p>On mountain's lofty top, a shameless whore,</p>
<p>Whose ken rov'd loosely round her. At her side,</p>
<p>As 't were that none might bear her off, I saw</p>
<p>A giant stand; and ever, and anon</p>
<p>They mingled kisses. But, her lustful eyes</p>
<p>Chancing on me to wander, that fell minion</p>
<p>Scourg'd her from head to foot all o'er; then full</p>
<p>Of jealousy, and fierce with rage, unloos'd</p>
<p>The monster, and dragg'd on, so far across</p>
<p>The forest, that from me its shades alone</p>
<p>Shielded the harlot and the new-form'd brute.</p>

`<p class="cantohead">CANTO XXXIII</p>
<div class="stanza"><p>&ldquo;The heathen, Lord! are come!" responsive thus,</p>
<p>The trinal now, and now the virgin band</p>
<p>Quaternion, their sweet psalmody began,</p>
<p>Weeping; and Beatrice listen'd, sad</p>
<p>And sighing, to the song', in such a mood,</p>
<p>That Mary, as she stood beside the cross,</p>
<p>Was scarce more chang'd. But when they gave her place</p>
<p>To speak, then, risen upright on her feet,</p>
<p>She, with a colour glowing bright as fire,</p>
<p>Did answer: "Yet a little while, and ye</p>
<p>Shall see me not; and, my beloved sisters,</p>
<p>Again a little while, and ye shall see me.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">Before her then she marshall'd all the seven,</p>
<p>And, beck'ning only motion'd me, the dame,</p>
<p>And that remaining sage, to follow her.</p>
<p class="slindent">So on she pass'd; and had not set, I ween,</p>
<p>Her tenth step to the ground, when with mine eyes</p>
<p>Her eyes encounter'd; and, with visage mild,</p>
<p>&ldquo;So mend thy pace," she cried, "that if my words</p>
<p>Address thee, thou mayst still be aptly plac'd</p>
<p>To hear them." Soon as duly to her side</p>
<p>I now had hasten'd: "Brother!" she began,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why mak'st thou no attempt at questioning,</p>
<p>As thus we walk together?" Like to those</p>
<p>Who, speaking with too reverent an awe</p>
<p>Before their betters, draw not forth the voice</p>
<p>Alive unto their lips, befell me shell</p>
<p>That I in sounds imperfect thus began:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lady! what I have need of, that thou know'st,</p>
<p>And what will suit my need." She answering thus:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of fearfulness and shame, I will, that thou</p>
<p>Henceforth do rid thee: that thou speak no more,</p>
<p>As one who dreams. Thus far be taught of me:</p>
<p>The vessel, which thou saw'st the serpent break,</p>
<p>Was and is not: let him, who hath the blame,</p>
<p>Hope not to scare God's vengeance with a sop.</p>
<p>Without an heir for ever shall not be</p>
<p>That eagle, he, who left the chariot plum'd,</p>
<p>Which monster made it first and next a prey.</p>
<p>Plainly I view, and therefore speak, the stars</p>
<p>E'en now approaching, whose conjunction, free</p>
<p>From all impediment and bar, brings on</p>
<p>A season, in the which, one sent from God,</p>
<p>(Five hundred, five, and ten, do mark him out)</p>
<p>That foul one, and th' accomplice of her guilt,</p>
<p>The giant, both shall slay. And if perchance</p>
<p>My saying, dark as Themis or as Sphinx,</p>
<p>Fail to persuade thee, (since like them it foils</p>
<p>The intellect with blindness) yet ere long</p>
<p>Events shall be the Naiads, that will solve</p>
<p>This knotty riddle, and no damage light</p>
<p>On flock or field. Take heed; and as these words</p>
<p>By me are utter'd, teach them even so</p>
<p>To those who live that life, which is a race</p>
<p>To death: and when thou writ'st them, keep in mind</p>
<p>Not to conceal how thou hast seen the plant,</p>
<p>That twice hath now been spoil'd. This whoso robs,</p>
<p>This whoso plucks, with blasphemy of deed</p>
<p>Sins against God, who for his use alone</p>
<p>Creating hallow'd it. For taste of this,</p>
<p>In pain and in desire, five thousand years</p>
<p>And upward, the first soul did yearn for him,</p>
<p>Who punish'd in himself the fatal gust.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;Thy reason slumbers, if it deem this height</p>
<p>And summit thus inverted of the plant,</p>
<p>Without due cause: and were not vainer thoughts,</p>
<p>As Elsa's numbing waters, to thy soul,</p>
<p>And their fond pleasures had not dyed it dark</p>
<p>As Pyramus the mulberry, thou hadst seen,</p>
<p>In such momentous circumstance alone,</p>
<p>God's equal justice morally implied</p>
<p>In the forbidden tree. But since I mark thee</p>
<p>In understanding harden'd into stone,</p>
<p>And, to that hardness, spotted too and stain'd,</p>
<p>So that thine eye is dazzled at my word,</p>
<p>I will, that, if not written, yet at least</p>
<p>Painted thou take it in thee, for the cause,</p>
<p>That one brings home his staff inwreath'd with palm.</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;I thus: "As wax by seal, that changeth not</p>
<p>Its impress, now is stamp'd my brain by thee.</p>
<p>But wherefore soars thy wish'd-for speech so high</p>
<p>Beyond my sight, that loses it the more,</p>
<p>The more it strains to reach it?&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;To the end</p>
<p>That thou mayst know," she answer'd straight, "the school,</p>
<p>That thou hast follow'd; and how far behind,</p>
<p>When following my discourse, its learning halts:</p>
<p>And mayst behold your art, from the divine</p>
<p>As distant, as the disagreement is</p>
<p>'Twixt earth and heaven's most high and rapturous orb.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">&ldquo;I not remember," I replied, "that e'er</p>
<p>I was estrang'd from thee, nor for such fault</p>
<p>Doth conscience chide me." Smiling she return'd:</p>
<p>&ldquo;If thou canst, not remember, call to mind</p>
<p>How lately thou hast drunk of Lethe's wave;</p>
<p>And, sure as smoke doth indicate a flame,</p>
<p>In that forgetfulness itself conclude</p>
<p>Blame from thy alienated will incurr'd.</p>
<p>From henceforth verily my words shall be</p>
<p>As naked as will suit them to appear</p>
<p>In thy unpractis'd view." More sparkling now,</p>
<p>And with retarded course the sun possess'd</p>
<p>The circle of mid-day, that varies still</p>
<p>As th' aspect varies of each several clime,</p>
<p>When, as one, sent in vaward of a troop</p>
<p>For escort, pauses, if perchance he spy</p>
<p>Vestige of somewhat strange and rare: so paus'd</p>
<p>The sev'nfold band, arriving at the verge</p>
<p>Of a dun umbrage hoar, such as is seen,</p>
<p>Beneath green leaves and gloomy branches, oft</p>
<p>To overbrow a bleak and alpine cliff.</p>
<p>And, where they stood, before them, as it seem'd,</p>
<p>Tigris and Euphrates both beheld,</p>
<p>Forth from one fountain issue; and, like friends,</p>
<p>Linger at parting. "O enlight'ning beam!</p>
<p>O glory of our kind! beseech thee say</p>
<p>What water this, which from one source deriv'd</p>
<p>Itself removes to distance from itself?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">To such entreaty answer thus was made:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Entreat Matilda, that she teach thee this.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">And here, as one, who clears himself of blame</p>
<p>Imputed, the fair dame return'd: "Of me</p>
<p>He this and more hath learnt; and I am safe</p>
<p>That Lethe's water hath not hid it from him.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="slindent">And Beatrice: "Some more pressing care</p>
<p>That oft the memory 'reeves, perchance hath made</p>
<p>His mind's eye dark. But lo! where Eunoe cows!</p>
<p>Lead thither; and, as thou art wont, revive</p>
<p>His fainting virtue." As a courteous spirit,</p>
<p>That proffers no excuses, but as soon</p>
<p>As he hath token of another's will,</p>
<p>Makes it his own; when she had ta'en me, thus</p>
<p>The lovely maiden mov'd her on, and call'd</p>
<p>To Statius with an air most lady-like:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come thou with him." Were further space allow'd,</p>
<p>Then, Reader, might I sing, though but in part,</p>
<p>That beverage, with whose sweetness I had ne'er</p>
<p>Been sated. But, since all the leaves are full,</p>
<p>Appointed for this second strain, mine art</p>
<p>With warning bridle checks me. I return'd</p>
<p>From the most holy wave, regenerate,</p>
<p>If 'en as new plants renew'd with foliage new,</p>
<p>Pure and made apt for mounting to the stars.</p>
